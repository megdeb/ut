      <title>16 Tips for Maintaining Trust During Feedback Collection</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2021-05-14-tipsformaintainingtrust/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2021-05-14-tipsformaintainingtrust/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trust is always a prerequisite for working with at-risk communities, but it becomes increasingly important when you are gathering feedback. If trust has been established, users are more likely to participate in the feedback process and provide honest responses without fear of judgment or risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resource is designed for organizational security auditors, digital security trainers, and other practitioners who have already built and established trust with an at-risk community and are planning to collect feedback on privacy and security tools from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-maintaining-trust-during-engagements--feedback-collection&#34;&gt;Tips for Maintaining Trust During Engagements &amp;amp; Feedback Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though trust can be established prior to an audit, training, or user engagement, the facilitator must take action to maintain and uphold that trust throughout the event. Below are suggestions to help ensure that participants feel safe and supported throughout the entire feedback collection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communicate transparently with partners about what you will be doing together and outline the overall plan. Be sure to manage expectations about time and involvement. Explain how the feedback you are collecting will be used and what impact it may have long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboratively establish rules or protocols for the gathering to ensure people feel safe (i.e. no photos, no social media posts, Chatham house rules, etc.). Confirming confidentiality at the beginning (and maintaining that confidentiality) can also help participants open up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where possible, conduct feedback collection in the local language. Participants will likely be able to more easily share challenges, frustrations, or features that they appreciate in the language they are most comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow through on your commitments and be communicative throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify and highlight something positive that you hear or learn from participants in order to help them build their confidence. It can be useful to begin a training or audit by collecting best practices. This will demonstrate to participants that they already take certain actions or use certain tools and reassure them prior to beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage participants to share challenges or mistakes from the perspective of someone else (perhaps a persona), so they do not feel shame in sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain technical concepts in accessible language so that people can understand how technical tools work and do not feel overwhelmed by complex terms and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind participants that you are not testing them as users, but rather you are testing the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure that your team of facilitators is diverse and representative of the community or organization with which you are working so participants feel comfortable. You can also provide opportunities for participants to be co-facilitators. Cascading or transferring information to a trusted member of the organization or community can be an effective way to communicate a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage questions throughout the session and provide different ways for people to engage (verbally, written, etc.). It is critical that you listen to participants. Continuously check-in with each participant and follow-up afterwards via phone or email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should plan for the engagement to be interactive and immersive, but you should also be adaptable and adjust as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location can also play a large role in making sure participants feel safe to fully engage, without fear or distraction. If funding permits, host events in a neutral location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give honest and straightforward answers, and respond as quickly as possible to requests for support. You should always be clear and specific about the functionalities of tools so organizations and communities can choose the tool that best fits their threat model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask open-ended questions, and create space for storytelling and exploring emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include short movement activities, which allow for linking body and content (i.e. finger ladders, shoulder rotation, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize privacy-preserving measures when collecting feedback from at-risk users. This may require you to use aliases, assign numbers, etc. to ensure that you are not linking results or feedback to specific individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are just getting started building trust with a new organization or community or you are eager to begin collecting feedback from existing partners, these tips and suggestions will help ensure you are centering the wellbeing of your participants while effectively collecting critical feedback from at-risk users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AXIS: A Global Feedback Exchange for Trainers, Auditors, Developers, and Designers</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-11-18-axis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-11-18-axis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Internews, with support from &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/&#34;&gt;Simply Secure&lt;/a&gt;, hosted a month-long virtual event entitled &lt;strong&gt;AXIS: A Global feedback Exchange for Trainers, Auditors, Designers, and Developers.&lt;/strong&gt; This event brought together key communities to map privacy and security tools being used by at-risk organizations and to identify concrete ways that we can support improvements to those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;66 participants&lt;/strong&gt; across the globe attended throughout the month including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41&lt;/strong&gt; Digital Security Trainers and Organizational Security Auditors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; Designers and UX Experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; Tool Developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; People Representing Other Communities (journalists, activists, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/AXIS_Map.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image of blue world map with dots placed in the USA, Mexico, Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe&#34; style=&#34;width: 40%; border: 0; padding: 2em; float: right;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maximize flexibility for participants, program content was made available in a variety of formats including podcasts, live sessions, and blog posts. Since AXIS was originally planned as an in-person event, one of our top priorities when making it virtual was to facilitate community building and trust among participants, particularly for those who are new to the digital security and Internet Freedom communities. While building community and trust can come naturally during in-person events, virtual gatherings require strategic facilitation to create opportunities for those connections to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the ways we facilitated collaboration and communication throughout the month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome Calls.&lt;/strong&gt; Prior to the start of AXIS, we hosted two “Welcome Calls” where participants could introduce themselves and get to know one another in an informal setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AXIS Community Slack.&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the month, participants were able to communicate with each other or the hosts via the AXIS Community Slack. The Slack served as a space for participants to make introductions, exchange resources, submit homework assignments, and even share music recommendations and pictures of their pets! Having this informal space for participants to communicate throughout the month (and afterwards) greatly contributed to the overall success of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community-led Skill Shares.&lt;/strong&gt; As part of AXIS programming, participants were invited and encouraged to share their own skills and expertise through live sessions, blog posts, and/or podcasts. 12 participants contributed to these skill-shares covering topics such as web accessibility, threat modeling, user research, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakout Groups and Shared Notes.&lt;/strong&gt; During live sessions, hosts used BigBlueButton’s breakout feature and shared collaborative notes on Riseup Pads to create smaller groups and allow participants to engage in the format they are most comfortable with, whether that be speaking or typing into the shared document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;axis-outputs-and-resources&#34;&gt;AXIS Outputs and resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of select AXIS sessions, participants contributed to the development of new resources, and provided feedback on existing resources. Content developed during the event, ranging from best practices for feedback collection to templates for archetypes, will be edited, designed, and integrated into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook/&#34;&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on User Personas, or fictional profiles of individuals created based on the real needs of users, the archetype templates developed during AXIS will expand the resources available to help trainers, auditors, designers, and developers analyze threat models and understand risks. AXIS participants contributed to the development of templates for the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Archetypes&lt;/strong&gt; will provide a snapshot of at-risk organizations who rely on privacy and security tools. These archetypes will highlight threats they face, tools they use, the size of the organization, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversary Archetypes&lt;/strong&gt; will provide a direct contrast to the organizational archetypes, as they will provide a snapshot of common threat actors, including some of their tactics, known targets, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templates for these resources will be shared with trainers and auditors so that they can contribute to a growing library of &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/personas/&#34;&gt;personas and archetypes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;axis-tracker-and-feedback-collection-certification&#34;&gt;AXIS Tracker and Feedback Collection Certification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each AXIS participant collected a virtual “stamp” for attending a session, reading a blog post, or listening to a podcast. Each stamp represented a different theme or topic, and an editable Progress Tracker allowed participants to track their progress throughout the event. Upon completion of the program, participants were eligible to receive an &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-31-axiscertification/&#34;&gt;AXIS Feedback Collection Certificate&lt;/a&gt;*. A total of 42 participants received a Feedback Collection Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/AXIS_Tracker.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image of printable game board with 10 stamps that can be added into square spaces to track progress&#34; style=&#34;width: 75%; border: 0; float: center;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the event, AXIS participants were invited to apply for the Feedback Collection Funding Pool, a small grants pool for individuals or organizations who would like to implement feedback collection from at-risk users during their trainings or audits. Many AXIS participants have expressed interest in collaborating with another trainer or auditor to implement these activities, demonstrating an increase in the amount of collaboration happening within the auditor and trainer community, particularly with regards to usability work. This feedback collection, combined with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/blog/2020-10-01-uxfund2020/&#34;&gt;UXFund&lt;/a&gt;, aims to improve the usability of open source security and privacy tools used by at-risk communities around the globe. Check back &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/blog/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for updates as we launch this work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logo, Progress Tracker, Icons, and all other design assets for AXIS were created by Juan Pablo Trujillo Romo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RightsCon 2020: Ensuring Users Have a Voice: Collecting and Integrating User Feedback</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-10-16-rightscon/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-10-16-rightscon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rightscon.org&#34;&gt;RightsCon&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading event on human rights in the digital age, was held online this year during the month of July 2020. Internews’ Ashley Fowler led a session entitled, “Ensuring users have a voice: collecting and integrating user feedback.” Since 2015, Internews has partnered with digital security trainers, design experts, and open source tool teams to improve the usability and accessibility of open source privacy and security tools. Valuable user feedback collected from across the globe has ensured that users have a voice in the design and development of the tools they rely on. This panel was composed of digital security trainers and accessibility experts who have experience collecting feedback from at-risk users as well as designers working with open source tool teams who have implemented usability and accessibility improvements based on user feedback. Below you can find highlights from the panelists, who shared lessons learned, best practices, and responded to questions about collecting and integrating user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashley Fowler, Technical Program Officer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://internews.org/&#34;&gt;Internews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panel:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nancy Reyes, Trainer and Accessibility Consultant at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a11ylab.com/?lang=EN&#34;&gt;Accessibility Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario Felaco, Security Auditor at &lt;a href=&#34;https://conexo.org&#34;&gt;Conexo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrie Winfrey, Founder and Design Lead at &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helen Nyinakiiza, Digital Security Trainer in Kampala, Uganda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-it-important-to-involve-users-in-the-design-and-development-of-open-source-tools-how-do-we-sustain-feedback-loops-between-at-risk-users-and-open-source-tool-teams&#34;&gt;Why is it important to involve users in the design and development of open source tools? How do we sustain feedback loops between at-risk users and open source tool teams?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists highlighted that many open source tools are developed in North America or Europe, far from the communities that heavily rely on these tools for their physical and digital security. Tool teams that do not have direct access to end users struggle to understand the specific needs and threats they face, sometimes resulting in tools that are difficult to use or neglect to account for people outside of North America and Europe. Involving users and creating sustainable feedback loops is critical to the success of any privacy or security tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback should not only be collected towards the end of the development cycle, but rather gathered throughout the entire process. Developers must ensure they have structured the process to power continuous feedback loops. For open source donors and funders, it is important to ask how the projects you’re supporting are incorporating feedback from at-risk or marginalized populations. Not only is it important to ask, but also demand that it is included and fund the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy noted that it is imperative to also include people with disabilities in the design process of the tool, and seek their feedback early on in the process, in order to build more accessible tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/AXIS/line.PNG&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; border: 0;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Accessibility Guidelines exist and can support the inclusion of people with disabilities. Learn more at &lt;a href=&#34;https://w3.org/TR/WCAG21/&#34;&gt;https://w3.org/TR/WCAG21/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/AXIS/line.PNG&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; border: 0;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-there-simple-ways-to-integrate-feedback-collection-into-existing-training-or-engagements-with-end-users&#34;&gt;Are there simple ways to integrate feedback collection into existing training or engagements with end users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of lightweight and fun ways to collect feedback! Panelists shared several methods they have used, emphasizing that you can even collect feedback over dinner or coffee. In fact, making it a no pressure, lightweight social event helps people feel more comfortable and results in more accurate, real feedback. If you are conducting a more formal digital security training, you can wander around and observe how people are interacting with the tool and identify where they are facing hurdles. Collect those insights and pain points as feedback you can later send to the tool developer. It can be particularly useful to identify a co-trainer or “observer” whose sole responsibility during a training is to watch and document user behavior, capturing specific feedback that can inform tool teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/AXIS/line.PNG&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; border: 0;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening groups, surveys, and trainings are all different channels for  collecting feedback. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook/&#34;&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook&lt;/a&gt; and the Okthanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/exploratorium&#34;&gt;Exploratorium&lt;/a&gt; for more activities! There are also initiatives like &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools&#34;&gt;USABLE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/labs/usability-lab/&#34;&gt;OTF Usability Lab&lt;/a&gt; that can fund user engagements or design and accessibility support for open source tool teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/AXIS/line.PNG&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; border: 0;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-role-does-trust-play-when-collecting-user-feedback&#34;&gt;What role does trust play when collecting user feedback?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy is an important factor when collecting feedback. We feel closer to things when we feel connected to the humans who designed them. When you can connect a tool developer directly with users, it helps to build trust and understanding, which in turn improves feedback and the tool! Users will be more likely to engage if they know  that developers are interested and their feedback will be heard. Even if you are not able to connect users directly to developers, make sure to let users know that their perspectives matter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to stay in touch with the users so that you can follow-up as they continue to use the tool. You can reach out to them to share any development or feature updates as they happen, capture any pain points that may have emerged as they become more familiar with the tool, and get feedback on any changes that have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-prevents-users-from-providing-feedback-to-developers&#34;&gt;What prevents users from providing feedback to developers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to make sure that development teams are listening. Collecting and sharing feedback requires your time and resources.  If you feel like your time and expertise are going into a void, what&amp;rsquo;s the point? Additionally, connectivity continues to be a huge challenge - both internet connectivity and human connectivity. Digital security trainers, or others skilled at connecting with a particular community, can play a huge role in bridging that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers face obstacles as well. Time, access, and resources are obvious challenges. Oftentimes, small tool teams simply may not have the bandwidth to review and act on all of the feedback coming in from users. Internews’ USABLE project has worked to mitigate some of these obstacles. Through the USABLE project, Internews offered financial support to digital security trainers to compensate them for the additional work of collecting and packaging feedback in ways that are easier for developers to receive and act on. For developers, Internews provided funding support for tool teams that were willing and able to implement some of the changes requested through direct user feedback. This approach has been helpful in making sure feedback is not only shared with developers, but also put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-get-involved&#34;&gt;How can I get involved?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a digital security trainer, a SAFETAG auditor, or a designer who wants to collect user feedback to help improve open source privacy and security tools, please reach out! We also encourage open source tool teams wishing to integrate user feedback into their design and development processes to connect with us. We have a robust network of community members eager to make tools more usable for those who need them most. Email us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:connect@usable.tools&#34;&gt;connect@usable.tools&lt;/a&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing the 2020-2021 UXFund</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-10-01-uxfund2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-10-01-uxfund2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the launch of the latest round of the UXFund, a targeted pool of funding dedicated to improving the usability of open source security and privacy tools used by at-risk communities around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers, maintainers, and other representatives of open source tool teams are invited to apply on behalf of an open source privacy and security tool. Winning applications must demonstrate a commitment to high-impact usability solutions, and incorporate human-centered design principles, including user testing, engagement with end-users, as well as a willingness to work directly with digital security trainers and auditors around the globe. The goal of this funding is to support stronger feedback loops among tool teams and their target user base, and ultimately make tools more usable for those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the UXFund will support work addressing the needs of at-risk persons and/or vulnerable populations (e.g. ethnic minorities, LGBTQI communities, people with disabilities, and women), but there are limited funds available for deeper tool re-architecture, if clear usability-enhancing outputs are presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This round of the UXFund will also prioritize tools or platforms that apply to address unique challenges that are faced at the organization or community level, such as shared password management or encrypted collaboration tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of funding provided will vary based on the specific needs of the tool, but will likely range from $5,000 to $50,000 USD. The funding period will likely span from November 2020 through June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deadline-to-apply&#34;&gt;DEADLINE TO APPLY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All applications should be submitted before November 15, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SAFETAG Community Feedback</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-09-24-communityfeedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-09-24-communityfeedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, we have been working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tafka.mx&#34;&gt;Tafka&lt;/a&gt;, a Mexico-based design firm, to develop a new visual identity for the SAFETAG framework. As part of these efforts, we hosted 3 community feedback calls to gather feedback. Additionally, we shared an open survey for those who were unable to join the calls. In total, we received feedback from over 25 SAFETAG users around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have highlighted some of the feedback we received below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAFETAG could be described as:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Complex, yet comprehensive”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Your really smart friend that you like a lot, but gives very detailed answers to very simple questions”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Flexible and adaptive”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes SAFETAG and its community unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We take the time to get to know, listen, and engage with the organization before starting hands-on work during the audit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are driven by the opportunity to support organizations advocating for civil and human rights, allowing them to do their work more safely and effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We strive to provide holistic support to organizations, taking into consideration digital, physical, and psycho-social components of their security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We enable organizations to make informed decisions regarding their digital security, and contribute to building a more resilient and sustainable foundation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAFETAG users believe the framework’s visual identity should be:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building blocks, or individual pieces that come together to form something larger and more comprehensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colorful and approachable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Casual, yet professional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenges do users face when navigating the framework?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is big. As a new auditor, it is difficult to understand the “big picture”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The document is overwhelming, and it is hard to decide which parts are relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No clear hierarchy or organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The information architecture is not intuitive, and it is difficult to search for content that will be relevant for a specific organization, community, or context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changes or features would make it easier to navigate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to hide activities so that you can see a smaller version of the framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less words, more visuals. A clear naming structure and hierarchy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A search feature, and a way to select specific activities that are relevant for a particular scenario&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using metadata (such as size of organization, theme of activity, etc.) to sort the activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Videos, tutorials, and lessons learned for activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a clear “table of contents” so it is easy to locate a specific section or activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenges do users face when contributing new content to the framework?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many users do not feel comfortable contributing content through GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others reported that contributing content currently takes too long; there are limited options for smaller, less time-consuming contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of contributing content is difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all who joined the feedback calls or responded to the survey! The insights you shared have directly informed the design and development of the new visual identity and web interface. We hope that the new visual assets and interface will make SAFETAG easier to use and more accessible for both new and experienced auditors. We are in the final stages of work and look forward to sharing the final products soon. Stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A very short story about digital security for young women</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-09-22-digisecjh/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-09-22-digisecjh/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, why has it become more important for young women to get to know about digital security? Because more and more, they’re using and living in the internet world, either for education, to earn some money, or simply to have fun. The exposure of young women to the digital world brings another effect – online harassment – which also has implication on their offline life. In recent research, &lt;a href=&#34;https://webfoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Web Foundation&lt;/a&gt; mentioned several threats online for women and girls in the internet world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t write about the material or technical components of digital security training, since every organization has their own module. Instead, I’ll discuss how to set up a training to become more appealing and friendly for a group of young women and less intimidating, without lessening the importance of the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to a laid back and discreet place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a laid back and fun situation, first we need to decide the theme and place. A small home with an open garden could be a good option, or if you have enough budget, we can organize a training in a resort, far away from bustling city life. Try to find a place that is discreet and quiet. To protect peoples’ security, the training will minimize the involvement of social media – no  mentions, no tagging, and minimize publications. A lesson that they also will learn in the training is that when it’s necessary, they can completely disconnect from the online world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a fun ambience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the term “training” could feel intimidating, we can choose a different format that is more fun for participants. Borrowing the format of a book club perhaps could help. When it comes to the session organizing, the participants could divide into a small groups, with 1-2 facilitators. Like a book club, the session is about sharing experiences from participants and the facilitator, covering what they need to know about digital security. It’s possible that ice-breaking activities would be needed to create closeness and gain trust among the participants and the facilitator.  The more relaxed the discussion is, the more sharing of knowledge that will take place among participants and facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital security training material is available widely on the internet. What we need is to raise the awareness and the implementation of these recommendations. Participants can start to become more aware of what platforms they use, and how to be more safe when using them. An introduction to open source platforms could also be a good place to start, as an alternative to closed source platforms that are relatively widely used. All they need to know to start is to be aware that digital harm could attack anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And, what’s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to create activities after training, as a follow up. Create online groups or some meet ups after the training, if possible. You could create a catchy ‘digital security tips and tricks’ guide, both in online and offline form, as a tool to use when we need to distribute information to people who don’t have sufficient access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Tips for Collecting Quality User Feedback from Grassroots HRDs, Activists, and Security Tool Users</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-28-10tipsforfeedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-28-10tipsforfeedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Security tools are vital to ensure at-risk users like human rights defenders and activists stay safe while doing their valuable work of activism and defending human rights. However, the usefulness of these tools depends on how usable they are to this at-risk community. Many feedback collection activities have been done to provide security tool developers with quality user feedback to ensure they develop these tools with the at-risk users in mind. Through USABLE, feedback is constantly being collected from at-risk communities around the security tools they use to stay safe. Feedback has been collected on security tools like Signal, VeraCrypt, KeepassXC, BitLocker, Tor Browser, and many others. Through conducting different digital security training and tool feedback sessions in East Africa since 2018, I have been able to interact with many grassroots communities and collect their feedback on key tools that they use. Grassroots communities in East Africa are particularly unique in that they face several challenges like poor internet connectivity, lack of electricity, and limited resources and equipment. These factors can greatly limit the adoption of certain security tools.
Below, I share my 10 tips for collecting quality user feedback from at-risk grassroots communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-understand-the-community-using-a-particular-security-tool&#34;&gt;1. Understand the community using a particular security tool.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the community you intend to collect feedback for. Not only does it enable you to plan accordingly, but it also gives you a clear picture of the needs of that community. This also makes it easy for you to focus on collecting feedback for specific tools used by that community based on their threat models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-know-which-security-tool-is-used-most-by-grassroots-communities-and-focus-on-collecting-feedback-for-that-tool&#34;&gt;2. Know which security tool is used most by grassroots communities and focus on collecting feedback for that tool.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the tool used by particular communities gives you the ability to make necessary arrangements on collecting feedback on specific features of that tool that is commonly used by the community. Tools like Tor Browser or VeraCrypt have many features and there may be some features that are more frequently used by particular communities. Once you know which tool and its specific features are used by grassroots communities, feedback collection for that tool becomes a little easier than going into a feedback collection activity without knowing which tool or feature is mostly used by that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-know-which-method-of-feedback-collection-works-best-for-that-community&#34;&gt;3. Know which method of feedback collection works best for that community.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to different factors and working conditions of grassroots communities, not all methods of feedback collection work for them. Grassroots communities, in particular, have many challenging factors which limit you from using certain methods of collecting feedback. For example, using virtual feedback collection methods like sending questionnaires or using surveys to collect feedback from grassroots communities is not a very practical method due to factors like limited access to the internet or low bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-understand-the-schedule-and-availability-of-the-community-to-provide-user-feedback&#34;&gt;4. Understand the schedule and availability of the community to provide user feedback.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of grassroots human rights defenders are constantly in the field working and doing a lot of travelling within their communities. If you intend to conduct tool feedback collection outside digital security training, you will need to make sure your schedule matches theirs to ensure the tool feedback collection activity is not getting in the way of their important work. Therefore, know which local events, training, or workshops bring these communities together and use it as an opportunity to organize a tool feedback collection. Liaise with event organizers to publicize your tool feedback collection activity and find a suitable location and time for you to collect the tool feedback during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-understand-the-barriers-which-exist-and-have-the-potential-to-hinder-the-community-from-using-a-particular-security-tool&#34;&gt;5. Understand the barriers which exist and have the potential to hinder the community from using a particular security tool.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before introducing grassroots communities to a new tool for which you want to collect feedback, know which barriers exist and have the potential to hinder its adoption by them. This will save you from wasting a lot of valuable time collecting feedback for a tool which the community has no interest in adopting simply because it’s not useful to them – no matter how useful or usable that particular tool is to another community. Barriers like lack of proper devices and equipment (like good laptops or smartphones) play a big role in the adoption of certain tools because certain tools work best on particular devices with specific system requirements. Also, certain tools like VeraCrypt are a little bit technical and need a certain level of expertise which many grassroots communities do not have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-understand-the-context-in-which-grassroots-communities-work&#34;&gt;6. Understand the context in which grassroots communities work.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different communities work under different contexts and knowing this beforehand enables the feedback collector to prepare in advance on what tools they will collect feedback for from that community. Likewise, grassroots communities also work in different contexts and it is particularly challenging to collect feedback if the feedback collector does not know their working context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-prepare-a-checklist-to-act-as-a-benchmark-when-collecting-the-user-feedback&#34;&gt;7. Prepare a checklist to act as a benchmark when collecting the user feedback.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of feedback that you will collect from grassroots communities during a feedback collection activity will vary from inferior to superior. Having a checklist will enable you to quickly rank feedback for particular features of a security tool and will ensure that you evaluate the feedback collection activity before and after the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-categorize-feedback-collected-and-rank-them-by-quality-remember-even-inferior-feedback-can-be-useful-to-tool-developers&#34;&gt;8. Categorize feedback collected and rank them by quality. Remember, even inferior feedback can be useful to tool developers.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting feedback from grassroots communities is challenging in terms of the quality of feedback you will receive. This is because people from grassroots communities are new to the idea of tool feedback collection, often get excited, and end up providing all the feedback they have. Collect all this feedback and categorize them according to the quality but submit all to the developers because all that feedback could potentially be useful to tool developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-if-possible-have-a-virtual-call-with-a-tool-developer-during-the-feedback-collection-activity-with-grassroots-participants&#34;&gt;9. If possible, have a virtual call with a tool developer during the feedback collection activity with grassroots participants.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a video call with a tool developer during a feedback collection activity makes a great difference and can be very motivating for grassroots participants and puts them in the mood to provide feedback for that tool. Many participants of tool feedback collection activities often are in disbelief that the feedback they provide will lead to improvement of the tool, but once they actually get to see and talk with the developer of that tool, they instantly get excited to provide the feedback because they know it will create an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-virtually-stay-in-touch-with-grassroots-participants-even-after-initial-physical-feedback-collection-activity&#34;&gt;10. Virtually stay in touch with grassroots participants even after initial physical feedback collection activity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes collecting feedback from grassroots communities needs constant connection with participants. This is because more valuable feedback can be collected even after the initial activity. Following up with participants through a phone call or WhatsApp chat gives you the opportunity to understand the challenges they have been facing while using the security tool. This method of virtual feedback collection is very efficient, fast, and easy and helps you to reach out to participants without interrupting much of their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, collecting user feedback from grassroots communities is very interesting despite the challenges that come with it but as a feedback collector, you have to always be accommodative and dynamic, ready to make changes as you go about collecting the feedback. One thing you have to keep in mind at all times is that tool feedback collection is a new and constantly evolving activity and it gets easier every time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesizing and Prioritizing Feedback</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-14-prioritizingfeedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-14-prioritizingfeedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collecting feedback from at-risk users is a critical first step, but it is not the final step in the process. To maximize the impact of the feedback loop between end-users and developers, trainers, auditors, and other facilitators should ensure that the feedback shared is of high quality, relevant, and consistent. This requires time spent reviewing, synthesizing, and prioritizing which pieces of feedback should be shared with the developer. The questions below will help guide trainers, auditors, and facilitators through this process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/Friends_Comic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image of comic that reads &#39;Before posting a new comic I sometimes ask a friend for feedback&#39;&#34; style=&#34;width: 40%; border: 0; float: right; padding: 1em;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-the-common-areas-of-confusion-or-frustration&#34;&gt;What are the common areas of confusion or frustration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to focus on feedback that is common among multiple users. If multiple people are experiencing similar frustrations, this demonstrates that it is a shared challenge and not a one-off “user” error or misunderstanding. Understanding the scale of the issue will also help the developer prioritize the improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-the-common-features-or-processes-that-users-appreciate-or-are-able-to-navigate-easily&#34;&gt;What are the common features or processes that users appreciate or are able to navigate easily?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is easy to focus on areas of a tool that users struggle with, it can also be helpful to highlight features or processes that users appreciate or depend on day-to-day. This information will ensure that developers do not change or remove these features in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-frequently-does-the-user-need-to-complete-the-task&#34;&gt;How frequently does the user need to complete the task?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the frequency of the task, as well as how important the task may be to the overall function of the tool. For example, if the user is struggling with a particular task within the tool, but it is not a task they will need to complete regularly (such as configuring settings), this may not be a priority for the developer. However, if it is a task that the user will need to complete on a regular basis that is causing frustration, this likely will be a priority for the developer. Alternatively, if a task does not need to be completed often, but is essential to the functioning of the tool, this can also be a major barrier that should be prioritized by the developer. For example, if a user struggles to install the program properly or setup the program to run, this may prevent them from properly using the tool, even though it may only need to be completed once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-this-piece-of-feedback-relevant-and-actionable&#34;&gt;Is this piece of feedback relevant and actionable?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facilitator, trainer, or auditor is also uniquely positioned to ensure that the feedback is relevant and useful. Not all users will have technical knowledge, which will influence the type of feedback that they are able to provide. For example, a user who does not understand how attackers could “spoof” a trusted contact even in a secure communication tool may not understand the importance of verifying contacts by comparing what is often presented as a very long code of letters and numbers, and therefore, never do it. While the specific complaint about the usability could be “this is too difficult / the code is too long;” a facilitator or trainer would be able to identify the root cause and help provide more actionable feedback to the developer. A request to “shorten” the code would likely be met with resistance from a cryptographic / security standpoint, but the trainer can suggest better ways to present critical information to the user (e.g., has the code changed?) and help identify more user-friendly but still cryptographically sound ways to present the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-concrete-suggestions-can-i-make-based-on-the-feedback-collected&#34;&gt;What concrete suggestions can I make based on the feedback collected?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond simply highlighting areas of confusion or frustration, the facilitator, trainer, or auditor is also a valuable voice when it comes to concrete suggestions for improvements. For example, if the language used on a specific button or configuration is confusing, suggest another word that may make the function of the button clearer to users. Similarly, instead of only highlighting that a specific word or phrase was not translated accurately, offer an alternative translation. These specific recommendations are very useful for the developer and give them concrete actions that they can take to improve the usability or accessibility of the tool or application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-streamline-the-feedback-process-and-maintain-this-feedback-loop-with-the-developer&#34;&gt;How can I streamline the feedback process and maintain this feedback loop with the developer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most developers receive ad-hoc feedback from passionate users, who typically have some level of technical knowledge, but do not usually represent the average user of the tool or application. Trainers, auditors, and facilitators are positioned to capture feedback from real users, prioritize it based on relevance and quality, and share it in a streamlined format. By formalizing this process, trainers and facilitators will be able to share feedback more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Usability to Threat Modeling</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-11-threatmodels/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-11-threatmodels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across our portfolio of technology, training, and advocacy to support a
free and open Internet that protects and advances human rights, we are
assembling a wide array of foundational resources (all released under
Creative Commons licenses!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;boxtext&#34; style=&#34; width: 40%; float: right; padding-left: .5em; margin-left: 1em; border-left: 2px solid gray;&#34;&gt;
&lt;h5  style=&#34;font-size: .75em;&#34;&gt;Threat Modeling in Internet Freedom Projects&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;font-size: .75em; line-height:1em; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#39;s important to underline that this is not a new concept -- certainly
there are many security tools which already carefully consider threat
models during development; there is much written on using use cases and
&#34;misuse cases&#34; to expose the security and usability requirements for
tools -- this paper provides a good overview, and EFF&#39;s Security
Education Companion coverage of Threat Models introduces the concept for
use in training.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include user personas with community-built lists of needs, and information about the threats or
adversaries they face. &lt;strong&gt;This collection of different resources is not
coincidental&lt;/strong&gt; – it builds a space in the middle to create detailed
&lt;strong&gt;threat models&lt;/strong&gt; around specific tools and practices and paves the way
to more expansive and cohesive long term digital safety strategies for
resilient communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-have&#34;&gt;What we have&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #005CAB;&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;At-Risk User Personas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #FBB034;&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contextual Digital Risk Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&#34;top&#34; style=&#34;padding: 15px;&#34; &gt;
&lt;!--&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools//images/personas/ky-alexandria.png&#34; alt=&#34;Example persona face&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; /&gt;--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://USABLE.tools&#34;&gt;USABLE.tools&lt;/a&gt; project has a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://USABLE.tools/personas&#34;&gt;user persona library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with 30+ user personas from around the world, representing LGBTQI activists, persons with disabilities, human rights defenders in closed states, and many more. These are not simply idealized stereotypes, however - they are created by the at-risk users themselves to provide authentic insight into the lived experiences, needs, and threats of these communities without putting any specific members of their community at risk. These personas provide critical insights into the needs and threats real people face in challenging environments. Tools for these communities need to be resilient against a wide variety of technical, physical, and legal attacks while also being easy to use, with little or no training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--[**User Personas**](https://usable.tools/personas/), or anonymized profiles of end-users, provide a critical insight into the people who engage -- or whom developers want to engage -- with tools. When we are thinking about tools to protect marginalized persons, vulnerable populations, and/or the activists, advocates, and human rights defenders supporting them, the stakes are high. --&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&#34;top&#34; style=&#34;padding: 15px;&#34; &gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Risk Assessments&lt;/strong&gt; are a core of Internews&#39; internal risk management process, and we also strongly encourage auditors using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://SAFETAG.org&#34;&gt;SAFETAG framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to leverage a similar approach to research the technical and social context that they are working in when assessing an organization&#39;s security. The framework provides a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/exercises/technical_context_research&#34;&gt;guide to research the technical capacity of potential threat actors&lt;/a&gt;, including both historical attack data and any indicators of changes to their capacity. Auditors are encouraged to also look at focal areas and trends.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-were-building&#34;&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;re building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-07-adoptable/&#34;&gt;next phase of USABLE&amp;rsquo;s work&lt;/a&gt;, we will be building two new resources - &amp;ldquo;personas&amp;rdquo; which represent the needs of organizations and communities and “personas” which capture the capabilities and motivations of realistic but generalized adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #6CB33F;&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Organizational Archetypes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #F15D22;&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adversary Personas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&#34;top&#34; style=&#34;padding: 15px;&#34; &gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Archetypes capture the complex needs of organizations and communities, spanning from grassroots communities all the way up to donors in the space facing state-level adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the more complex needs and different threats faced when collaborating? Secure messaging, calls, and document collaboration are all significantly more complex when you have multiple people or organizations involved, and tools which are relatively easy to swap in and out at a personal level become incredibly more complex if an entire organization depends upon them as a core part of their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&#34;top&#34; style=&#34;padding: 15px;&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversary Personas will contain realistic details of generalized adversaries’ capacities and what issues these actors are willing to expend resources and build capacity to undermine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations will be able to use these resources to anticipate potential threats and malicious actions and proactively develop practices and responses to realistic situations. This will enable developers, trainers, policymakers, funders, and others to contextualize their work against a wider variety of threat actors without having to rely on any one specific nation-state as a &amp;ldquo;bogeyman.&amp;rdquo; I specifically hope this enables richer conversation around actual threats while removing cultural stereotypes and prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-resources-to-practice&#34;&gt;From Resources to Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are collectively designed to enable unbiased discussions and
strategy development around the serious challenges and threats users,
organizations, and entire communities face, the tools we use to help,
and tools, practices, or policies we wish we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responses focused on threats, not just threat actors&lt;/strong&gt; Threat
actors change and evolve, and often have more capacity than is
publicly confirmed (but perhaps less than is presumed through
rumor). By extracting and de-personalizing aspects of this, we can
have clearer discussions. Further, specifying current existing
actors, especially in open source tools, can overly complicate the
public profile of the tool as well as those using it. If a tool is
clearly built to combat a specific actor, then users of that tool
can be seen as inherently being aligned against that actor. This has
resulted already in excessive targeting and jailing of activists
based on their tool choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification of common, cross-regional threats&lt;/strong&gt; What attacks,
specific techniques, and even malicious tools are being used and
re-used globally? Are there patterns we can detect and build
proactive defenses against?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gap identification&lt;/strong&gt; What gaps remain when we look at this data
mapped out? Is anyone working to address them? What solutions
(tools, training, policy changes) could be used? How do we
sustainably build these resources?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More dynamic responses, more resilient communities&lt;/strong&gt; By tackling
the inputs into this process separately, we can update our models
more agilely and plan against a wider variety of attacks to build
tools and guidance that are more resilient to more types of threat
actors as well as changes in any specific actor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future-looking strategies&lt;/strong&gt; With these fictional personas and
archetypes, we do not have to be as limited to current actors and
their capacities. We can (within reason) consider possible future
threats that activists may face by remixing and extrapolating from
current threats. Anticipating these risks will allow us to build
tools to mitigate sooner, rather than later. &lt;em&gt;Dystopian cyberpunk
scenarios welcome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These resources can be used to develop &lt;strong&gt;tabletop scenarios&lt;/strong&gt; to
explore current and emerging threats and build creative responses to
them. These scenarios are useful in advanced trainings, tool
development, and strategy building exercises. Fictional but
realistic adversaries and personas can get into detail around
specific threats and mitigations without being as personal, risking
bias, and helping reduce potential of trauma involved in these
discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just getting started and would love to hear from you on what
data you hope to find in these resources, how you would use and adapt
them, and more! You can reach us at
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:connect@usable.tools&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;connect@usable.tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overview of Feedback Collection Activities</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-07-axisoverview/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-07-axisoverview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;internews&#34;&gt;Internews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ux-feedback-collection-guidebook&#34;&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the most at-risk communities around the globe rely on open source privacy and security tools. However, these tools are often designed, developed, and maintained by individuals or small teams who have little to no access to their target audience — journalists, activists, human rights defenders, and other high-risk groups. This often results in tools that poorly fit the threats, challenges, and/or accessibility or usability requirements of end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further facilitate feedback loops between tool developers and the at-risk communities using those tools, Internews worked with trainers, designers, and developers from around the globe to create the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook/&#34;&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a compilation of activities and resources designed to integrate feedback collection into existing digital security training frameworks. These activities and resources allow trainers, auditors, and facilitators to collect relevant and useful feedback from high-risk users that are typically underrepresented in the design and development of open source privacy and security tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guidebook equips digital security trainers and other trusted facilitators with the skills and resources they need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safely gather information around end-users’ needs, practices, and operating environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect tool-specific feedback from at-risk users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthesize, prioritize, and structure information or feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share information or feedback with relevant developers or tool teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resource will help practitioners understand the value and process of capturing feedback where possible and how to share it with developers. When done effectively, this process can transform the design and development of the most commonly used privacy and security tools for at-risk users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;okthanks&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our work, we rely on our trusted local partners to help us understand the needs and desires of communities. Activities and frameworks serve as a guide, so that our partners know which questions to ask and what information is needed to inform the design of a tool. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.okthanks.com/exploratorium&#34;&gt;The Exploratorium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; contains many of the methods and activities we use in our practice when conducting user research, engaging communities in the design process, and measuring impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-exploratorium&#34;&gt;THE EXPLORATORIUM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.okthanks.com/exploratorium&#34;&gt;The Exploratorium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of activities that seeks to inspire participant engagement and foster relationships built on trust, inclusivity, and freedom, so all voices are heard and represented. They can be used as part of a user research plan or for gathering feedback. These activities aim to cultivate honest input, and generate meaningful and actionable insights. Use them in a group setting, at an event, or in a virtual focus group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping individuals safe and implementing privacy-preserving measures when engaging is very important. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/our-research-principles&#34;&gt;‘Our Research Principles’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; outline some of the questions we discuss as a team and with our partners when planning an engagement. Before deploying an activity, please consider how you are protecting the safety and privacy of participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can find all the activities on the Exploratorium page of our website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/exploratorium&#34;&gt;https://okthanks.com/exploratorium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;facilitator guide&lt;/strong&gt; accompanies every activity, outlining everything you need to know to deploy the activity, along with ideas for remote or virtual deployment! We understand how important it is to localize activities and currently have a few options localized, but would love to work together to do more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ways to utilize an Exploratorium activity within your program visit our blog post entitled, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/blog/12activities-engage-communities-feedback-2019/8/23&#34;&gt;“10 Activities to Engage Communities and Gather Feedback.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We would love this collection to grow, so if you have activities you love, feedback on these activities, or ideas for activities you’d like to see, contact us on Signal or WhatsApp @ +1 209.396.5087 or through email at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hello@okthanks.com&#34;&gt;hello@okthanks.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simply-secure&#34;&gt;Simply Secure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering feedback can feel overwhelming! We’ve developed a number of resources — lightweight guides and templates — to try to make it easier to add into your regular engagements with people in your communities, at trainings, or convenings depending on the type of feedback you are interested to collect. As we’re frequently working with high-risk participants, we also prioritize &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/blog/design-spot-high-risk-research&#34;&gt;safety and security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as part of our feedback gathering practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to gathering feedback, it might be best to start with the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/knowledge-base/beginners/&#34;&gt;beginners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; section of our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/knowledge-base/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or with our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/ux-starter-pack/&#34;&gt;UX Starter Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Interviews and surveys are great methods for getting in-depth, qualitative and open-ended feedback, but we’ve also found it can be helpful to invite people to draw and annotate feedback on paper. We’ve shared an example exercise like this in our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/blog/feedback-gathering-guide&#34;&gt;App Feedback Gathering Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/blog/design-spot-tool-feedback&#34;&gt;Design Spot: Quick Tool Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; video. These tools and methods can be useful to developers, designers, trainers and auditors and are intended to help bring to light challenges that people have using different tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selecting a Tool and Identifying Developers During the Feedback Collection Process</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-07-selectingtool/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-08-07-selectingtool/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trainers and auditors should have the ability and framework to do quick research on tools before beginning the feedback collection process. This quick checklist helps trainers, auditors, and trusted facilitators determine whether or not they should choose to spend time collecting feedback on a particular tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to beginning feedback collection on any specific tool, it is important to consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-the-project-active-is-the-project-sustainable&#34;&gt;Is the project active? Is the project sustainable?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything else, ensure the project is currently active. This means developers are currently working to update and make improvements on the product. With many open source projects, development may fluctuate due to lack of funding, volunteers, or time. Please refer to the checklist below to ensure the tool is actively maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with a Google search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore the project’s website to find where they host their code. This is often GitHub, but could also be GitLab, SourceForge or a custom site for larger projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for information on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://openhub.net&#34;&gt;OpenHub.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. OpenHub is a platform that gives you immediate data about current open source projects hosted on GitHub. Simply type the name of a tool in the search function and the output is a status report of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference the criteria used by the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://openintegrity.org/framework/tool_selection_criteria/&#34;&gt;Open Integrity Index by iilab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional considerations may also be taken depending on your context or concerns within the high-risk community you’re working with - e.g., has the tool been audited or peer-reviewed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be helpful to check if the project seems to be stable. Does the project have funding? Is it part of an organization? This is often harder to determine, but can save a lot of wasted effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-there-a-way-to-submit-feedback-is-there-a-preferred-method-of-feedback-submission-specifically-for-user-feedback&#34;&gt;Is there a way to submit feedback? Is there a preferred method of feedback submission (specifically for user-feedback)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize the impact of the feedback you are able to collect, look up the tool developers and how to contact them in advance. It can be frustrating to collect valuable feedback, but have no one to share it with. You may be able to identify specific developers via the tool’s website, GitHub, or the tool’s social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not always be able to know which method of feedback is preferred. If you do and you are comfortable or familiar with this method, contact the developers through this channel. If not, submit the feedback via the method with which you feel most comfortable. Submitting feedback via a less common channel is better than submitting no feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things a bit easier, USABLE has put together a quick list of products that have been vocal about wanting feedback from their users. This list of tools can be found &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/pdfs/UXfeedbackCollectionGuidebook_ListOfTools.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feedback Collection Certification</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-31-axiscertification/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-31-axiscertification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to offer a new &lt;strong&gt;AXIS Feedback Collection Certification&lt;/strong&gt;. As part of our 2020 event, &lt;strong&gt;Axis: A Global Feedback Exchange for Trainers, Auditors, Designers, and Developers&lt;/strong&gt;, we are bringing together key communities to map privacy and security tools being used by at-risk organizations and to identify concrete ways that we can support improvements to those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the convenings, participants will explore and provide feedback on existing feedback collection resources such as The UX Feedback Collection Guidebook, the Exploratorium, and more. They will map tools being used in at-risk communities, develop organizational archetypes and adversary personas, practice feedback collection activities, learn how to synthesize and prioritize feedback, how to share that information with tool developers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week of the convening offers participants a chance to collect stamps toward the Feedback Collection Certification by engaging and interacting with fundamental concepts important to understanding and implementing feedback within their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the convenings, participants will be able to integrate feedback collection into their existing audits and/or trainings, resulting in actionable feedback that will be shared directly with tool teams and developers. Additionally, participants will have the option to apply for funding to put these skills into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals who receive this certification have the following qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge of Open Source Tools:&lt;/strong&gt; Knowledge of open source privacy and security tools being developed and maintained, as well as an awareness of which at-risk communities are relying on these tools&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human-Centered Design and User-Experience</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-31-uxandhcd/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-31-uxandhcd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-centered design&lt;/strong&gt; is a principle that intentionally places humans, their needs, their concerns, and their experiences front and center when building a system. This system could be a piece of software or a product, but it could also be a process like conducting a security assessment or creating a resource for your community. Co-creation is an integral part of human-centered design, products and software that are collaboratively developed are more likely to meet the needs of a broader user base. Components of human-centered design include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building empathy&lt;/strong&gt; with the users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying needs&lt;/strong&gt; based on observations, interactions, and user feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative ideation&lt;/strong&gt; to solve challenges users experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping&lt;/strong&gt; without technical implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; to validate decisions made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing&lt;/strong&gt; based on findings during the testing phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observing&lt;/strong&gt; and collecting more user feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User-experience, or UX,&lt;/strong&gt; is a holistic way someone may experience the service, the product, or the system from all aspects - usability to information architecture and layout to things like likelihood of making a mistake or being able to recover from said mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are these two concepts related? If we are able to understand our users, or more importantly, empathize with them using human-centered design principles, we are often left with better results. Our products, services, processes, or overarching system will be more resilient and more effective in achieving their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key feature to both human-centered design principles and good user-experience is communicating with the user in the form of feedback. In the software development world, it is important &lt;strong&gt;to collect feedback early and often&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid problems later on in the development lifecycle, For example, spending hours engineering a product without inputting user feedback into the process can result in a product that no one will use. Not only is it likely to be difficult for your users, but changes will be more costly if made at the end of the cycle rather than the beginning, when very little to any code is written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By involving trainers in the feedback process through the activities in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook&#34;&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook&lt;/a&gt;, USABLE provides a space for tool developers to learn about specific threats faced by their users, the risks they take, and challenges they face, in addition to tool-specific feedback to improve the design for high-risk users. Likewise, it gives trainers and high-risk users a platform to share their feedback and lived experiences, while impacting security and privacy products their communities need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Development Ecosystems &amp; The Role of Trainers and Auditors</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-31-ecosystems/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-31-ecosystems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though business models vary case by case, there are significant differences between the development ecosystems of closed source tools (many of which are private and commercial) and open source tools. By understanding the humans and processes behind the tool, we can tailor our feedback and maximize the impact of our usability and accessibility recommendations. This blog explores tool team structures, providing insight into the design and development processes they implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-closed-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Understanding the Closed Source Ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the most popular private sector tools are closed source and well resourced. Most of these tools have well-established business models (including paid services and advertisements) that provide significant funding streams. They often have large teams of people working on the tool, specializing in particular areas such as design, user-experience, or marketing. In addition to large teams of developers or engineers who are focused on back-end development, many private sector tools will also have entire teams devoted to user testing or providing support to end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this ecosystem, end users are rarely engaging directly with developers. Feedback from users is filtered through multiple team members (user support, UX experts, designers, etc.) and is vetted at multiple levels before eventually being converted into specific edits or changes to the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these well-resourced tools often have offices located around the globe and can afford to conduct targeted user-testing if they are seeking input from a particular user group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few examples of Closed Source Ecosystems include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-open-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Understanding the Open Source Ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, many of the most-used and most-critical open source digital security tools are maintained and updated by “tool teams” rather than businesses or organizations. These ad-hoc groups have little if any institutional capacity, are often under-resourced, and have limited insight into the specific needs of at-risk users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survival of many of these tools is dependent on the dedication of volunteers, often working in their free time simply because they are passionate about the project. Some tools are developed and maintained by only one core individual. Additionally, these small teams seldom include specific UX, user-research, or design experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While USABLE has experienced great results with tool teams that have the capacity to address identified usability barriers, many tool teams simply lack the necessary personnel or organizational structures that would allow them to respond directly or even receive funding to support a response. This traps tool teams – and by extension, the community of high-risk tool users – in a vicious cycle of only being able to focus on the most immediate and urgent needs without being able to prioritize long-term usability or scalability improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few examples of Open Source Ecosystems include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Guardian Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mailvelope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KeePassXC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-role-of-trainersauditors&#34;&gt;The Role of Trainers/Auditors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these ecosystems, relevant and synthesized feedback from at-risk users via proper channels is incredibly valuable, particularly for open source tool teams with limited capacity. Trainers, auditors, and other facilitators who engage regularly with at-risk users are uniquely positioned to serve as trusted intermediaries between end users and tool teams. Based on their in-depth knowledge of user needs and challenges, as well as their understanding of privacy and security tools, trainers and auditors are able to synthesize and prioritize feedback. By ensuring that tool teams receive high-quality feedback reduces the burden for development teams, particularly those that may have limited bandwidth and resources, and increases the likelihood of tool teams implementing meaningful usability and accessibility enhancements within the tools at-risk communities rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though resources and structures may vary, the important role that users play in each of these ecosystems is undeniable. It is critical that we continue to connect, build trust, and close the feedback loop between tool creators and end users. In the end, we are all part of the same ecosystem working towards a more usable and secure future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing ADOPTABLE</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-07-adoptable/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-07-07-adoptable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-adoptable-equipping-at-risk-organizations-with-localized-expertise-resources-and-tools-to-mitigate-digital-attacks&#34;&gt;Introducing ADOPTABLE: Equipping at-risk organizations with localized expertise, resources, and tools to mitigate digital attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human rights organizations around the globe continue to face ongoing and increasing digital security threats from state and non-state actors. ADOPTABLE (Adaptable Digital and Organizational Protections by Transforming and Building Long-term Ecosystems) is an Internews project designed to help these at-risk organizations access relevant resources (human, financial, and technical tools) that will allow them to continue to operate safely. Without access to local organizational security experts, usable security and privacy tools, buy-in from decision-makers, and support from funders to adopt stronger safety practices, the organizations and their beneficiaries remain at risk, as does their crucial work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-project-consists-of-four-core-components&#34;&gt;The project consists of four core components:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-expanding-the-capacity-of-regional-and-local-partners-to-address-organizational-security-risks&#34;&gt;1. Expanding the capacity of regional and local partners to address organizational security risks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internews will support experienced partners in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe to become &lt;strong&gt;regionally recognized centers of expertise&lt;/strong&gt; on organizational security and build out local and regional ecosystems of organizational security auditors. Partners will conduct Trainings of Auditors (ToA’s) to train and/or upskill local security auditors in their regions on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://safetag.org&#34;&gt;SAFETAG framework&lt;/a&gt;. These newly trained auditors will work with experienced auditors to gain first-hand experience in conducting audits, while also collecting feedback on organizational security tools being used by at-risk organizations. To improve the scalability of this localization of expertise, Internews is also working to improve the SAFETAG onboarding and training process and make the framework more accessible by developing a &lt;strong&gt;new interface&lt;/strong&gt;. More on that process &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/blog/2020-05-13-safetag-community-call/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-improving-the-adoption-of-organizational-security-practices-within-at-risk-organizations&#34;&gt;2. Improving the adoption of organizational security practices within at-risk organizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internews will fund at least 5 audits or engagements in each of the three target regions. At-risk organizations will undergo a &lt;strong&gt;full security audit&lt;/strong&gt; and receive a detailed &lt;strong&gt;Risk Reduction Plan&lt;/strong&gt; (RRP), which outlines tangible steps they can take to mitigate their risks. Even after a security audit, Internews has found that many organizations lack the resources needed to implement the recommendations provided by an expert. Without the ability to implement these changes, organizations are no more secure than they were before an audit. Internews will ensure that these organizations are able to implement the recommended changes by &lt;strong&gt;providing direct financial support after the audits.&lt;/strong&gt; A variety of mitigation efforts may be eligible for support, including trainings for organization staff, facilitation of a security service by a third party, or the purchase of software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-developing-and-enhancing-feedback-collection-mechanisms-to-ensure-at-risk-users-have-a-voice-in-the-design-and-development-of-open-source-privacy-and-security-tools&#34;&gt;3. Developing and enhancing feedback collection mechanisms to ensure at-risk users have a voice in the design and development of open source privacy and security tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the USABLE approach, Internews created feedback loops between at-risk users, digital security trainers, and open source tool developers. Internews will continue to collect feedback from at-risk individual users, while also expanding to capture organization-wide feedback on security and privacy tools. Most notably, the USABLE approach will be integrated into the SAFETAG framework, allowing SAFETAG auditors to identify gaps and usability issues with privacy tools being used at the organizational level. Through virtual &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/blog/2020-04-03-cross-regional-convenings/&#34;&gt;Cross-Regional Convenings&lt;/a&gt;, Internews will work with partners to update the activities in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook&#34;&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook&lt;/a&gt;, develop organizational archetypes to further build out our library of user personas, and map the current landscape of open source tools being used by at-risk communities around the globe. Following the virtual convenings, Internews will launch a &lt;strong&gt;pool of funding for trainers and auditors&lt;/strong&gt; to integrate feedback collection activities into their digital security trainings or organizational audits. The high-quality feedback collected during these engagements will be shared with developers through their preferred channels. Key communities will convene once more at the end of the project for the third &lt;strong&gt;UXForum&lt;/strong&gt; to continue devising ways to scale and sustain feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-enhancing-the-usability-and-accessibility-of-open-source-privacy-and-security-tools&#34;&gt;4. Enhancing the usability and accessibility of open source privacy and security tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internews will launch the third round of the &lt;strong&gt;UX Fund&lt;/strong&gt;. This funding pool will provide support to privacy and security tool teams, enabling them to work with UX and accessibility experts to implement human-centered, usability-focused tool improvements. These changes will ultimately strengthen the tools, making them more &lt;strong&gt;secure for the at-risk individuals and organizations&lt;/strong&gt; who need them the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;we believe that with more localized tools and stronger local support, at-risk organizations will be better equipped to withstand the digital attacks and surveillance they currently face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IFF OrgSec Village: Day Five</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-06-15-iff-osv-day5/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-06-15-iff-osv-day5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;iff-orgsec-village&#34;&gt;IFF OrgSec Village&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internews is hosting the virtual Internet Freedom Festival (IFF) Organizational Security Village throughout this week (June 8-12)! The event is bringing together security auditors, digital security trainers, and other experts and practitioners for a five-day program of over 20 community-led sessions exploring five major themes in organizational security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions on Day 5 focused on funding OrgSec work and Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation. Highlights from Day 5 of the OrgSec village included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discussion around how small, local digital support initiatives can &lt;strong&gt;fund digital security assistance&lt;/strong&gt; for nonprofits through strategic networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brainstorm around ways to better &lt;strong&gt;support digital security programs&lt;/strong&gt; through informing and coordinating with donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open dialogue on &lt;strong&gt;evaluating audit success&lt;/strong&gt; from an auditor’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A presentation of frameworks to measure the &lt;strong&gt;impact&lt;/strong&gt; of organizational security work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways from the discussions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing funding is a challenge for OrgSec practitioners.&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations need to better incorporate digital and organizational security into their budgets and marketing and communications plans. More broadly, there is a need for coordination within the local and international OrgSec community to promote knowledge sharing and establish partnerships in order to educate and coordinate with donors more effectively. Donors also need to adopt digital security practices that allow them to engage with organizations and support their work safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community members debated the value of establishing certifications or skills qualifications&lt;/strong&gt; for work in the space in order to reduce the reliance on trust networks. This could reduce barriers to funding and opportunities for work for new practitioners who may be less known to both funders and at-risk organizations seeking support. However, establishing community-wide agreed upon standards and mitigating the substantial additional barriers to entry (e.g. cost, training opportunities and locations, personal and unfunded time) caused by any such certification system pose a formidable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring the impact of OrgSec programs is important&lt;/strong&gt; in order to evaluate and improve approaches and communicate success to donors. While it is easy to focus on measuring purely digital risk, is it important to bear in mind that effective OrgSec should take a &lt;strong&gt;holistic&lt;/strong&gt; approach also incorporating psychosocial support and physical aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether to evaluate OrgSec interventions using shared community standards or by measuring change within an organization and against its own threat model&lt;/strong&gt; continued to inspire debate among community members. The Engine Room shared a &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgsec.community/display/OS/Monitoring+and+Evaluation+Framework++for+Organisational+Security&#34;&gt;Monitoring and Evaluation Framework&lt;/a&gt; for Organizational Security - which takes the latter approach - for practitioners to adapt for their own M&amp;amp;E practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat detection isn’t only about fancy technology!&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of endpoint detection is process and practice-oriented. Impressing the importance of antivirus and software updates, teaching partners what abnormal activity looks like, or making sure they know the process for calling first responders takes training, process development, and awareness raising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust is a key component of threat information sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing who and where to share information about threats requires personal connections and existing trust relationships, which can feel like a barrier to entering the space. But community networks like the Computer Incident Response Center for Civil Society (CiviCERT) and information sharing standards such as the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) can lower barriers and facilitate sharing through established community standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started in threat analysis requires trust, skills, and time.&lt;/strong&gt; Though you will eventually need computers powerful enough to run virtual machines, more advanced skills, and connections to other researchers and communities like CiviCERT, don’t be intimidated by the technical jargon! All it takes to get started is a willingness to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human rights advocates are facing attacks&lt;/strong&gt; such as phishing and publication of their identifying details by government or state-sponsored adversaries that are based on online open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering. When threat modeling, it is important to identify the types of public data that makes you vulnerable and that adversaries may try to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>IFF OrgSec Village: Day Three</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-06-11-iff-osv-day3/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-06-11-iff-osv-day3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;iff-orgsec-village&#34;&gt;IFF OrgSec Village&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internews is hosting the virtual Internet Freedom Festival (IFF) Organizational Security Village throughout this week (June 8-12)! The event is bringing together security auditors, digital security trainers, and other experts and practitioners for a five-day program of over 20 community-led sessions exploring five major themes in organizational security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions on Day 3 continued to explore examples of OrgSec in Practice. Highlights from Day 3 of the OrgSec village included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collective discussion around what we mean as a community when we say &lt;strong&gt;OrgSec Crisis Response,&lt;/strong&gt; and how we can provide comprehensive crisis response support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An informal session sharing practitioners’ experiences conducting &lt;strong&gt;Remote Organizational Assessments, Remote Tech Assistance, and other remote interventions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case study of one organization’s experience launching a &lt;strong&gt;Website with Digital Security Instructions&lt;/strong&gt; and the unexpected ways audiences used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A presentation on the &lt;strong&gt;RAWRR (Risk Assessment Workflow Recommendation Roadmap) tool&lt;/strong&gt; for documenting security assessments, risk modelling, recommendation development and implementation monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of &lt;strong&gt;Security Governance in CSOs&lt;/strong&gt; exploring ways to scale policy development approaches to different sizes, capacities, and complexities of organizations and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways from the discussions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote interventions do work, but require more time and preparation than face-to-face support.&lt;/strong&gt;  Remote interventions can save time and money spent on travel, and can be the right format for rapid response or consultations (especially when trust is already established) as well as for facilitated online learning. However, they require significant time investment, and present numerous additional challenges. For example, remote trust building is tricky, and many people are uncomfortable enabling remote device access. Technical barriers like poor internet connectivity or lack of tech skills among staff may emerge. Finally, it is impossible to provide full technical support if something goes wrong that can&amp;rsquo;t be fixed remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web-based digital security guides are not dead (but keep them simple)!&lt;/strong&gt; Websites with complicated interactive guides addressing specific threat models don’t get sustained engagement and are difficult and expensive to maintain long-term. In contrast, sites with a set of searchable, specific, and updated instructions for different tools and cases can be a useful resource for post-audit and training communications and remote support and incident response. In addition, they are easier to keep up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s crucial to tailor security audit reports to the audience in mind.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether the report is for management or IT staff with technical know-how will dictate the specificity and structure of the report. There was community consensus that risk should be the focus of audit reports. Shorter reports focusing on action steps may be useful for organizations with limited bandwidth and interest in holistic security; in-depth reports detailing the process and connecting recommendations to risk are a more useful resource for organizations wishing to replicate the process down the line or build their own internal digital security expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When developing organizational security policies, don’t start from scratch!&lt;/strong&gt; There are many existing policy frameworks for practitioners to draw upon when assisting civil society organizations. Start with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usesoap.app/&#34;&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdamanual.org/&#34;&gt;SDA&lt;/a&gt;, and resources from &lt;a href=&#34;https://communitydocs.accessnow.org/370-Organizational_Security_Policy.html&#34;&gt;Access Now&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sandbox.cryptpad.info/bounce/#https%3A%2F%2Forgsec.community%2Fdisplay%2FOS%2FCreating%2Borganisational%2Bsecurity%2Bpolicies&#34;&gt;OrgSec Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-not-too-late-to-register&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not too late to register!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions on Day 2 explored examples of OrgSec in Practice. Highlights from Day 2 of the OrgSec village included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collaborative survey of the &lt;strong&gt;OrgSec Community’s Response to Emerging Crises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A presentation of work carried out with the &lt;strong&gt;Mechanism for the Integral Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists in Mexico City&lt;/strong&gt;, including a typology and workflow for the diagnosis of digital incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discussion around &lt;strong&gt;Non-technical Due Diligence&lt;/strong&gt; when choosing security tools and services, exploring questions on jurisdiction, open sourcing, and reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exploration of alliances as a support mechanism to guarantee the &lt;strong&gt;Digital Security of Human Rights Defenders Working in Civic and Internet Repressive Environments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A step-by-step playbook of the &lt;strong&gt;OrgSec Audit Process&lt;/strong&gt; in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hard look at how &lt;strong&gt;Digital Security Trainings Can Do More Harm than Good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways from the discussions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-sector partnerships can expand OrgSec support.&lt;/strong&gt; At times, it can be advantageous for organizations providing digital security support to at-risk communities to coordinate with government agencies offering similar support mechanisms. Traditional training methods combined with local and federal protection mechanisms allow for maximum protection for those communities who are most at-risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approaches to OrgSec must be adapted to the local context or threat model.&lt;/strong&gt; What may be a serious threat to one organization, may not be to another. When working with an organization, it is important to understand the threats that are relative to their work and/or location. What are the risks that they face? What has been happening to similar organizations in the region? It is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather needs to be tailored to the needs and capacity of each organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower organizations with the knowledge and guidance to understand and mitigate their risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Security can be overwhelming, particularly for less-technical users. It is critical for an auditor or trainer to focus on the how and why and not just the end result. The more organizations understand, the more confident they will be. This will better equip them to replicate the process in the future. Accessible language and easy to navigate guides and checklists can facilitate this sharing of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when your support does more harm than good.&lt;/strong&gt; Digital security trainings are helpful &amp;ndash; except for when they’re not. As an auditor or trainer, it is often difficult to find the time needed to properly onboard organizations to the security practices they need. Behavior change takes time and cannot be accomplished in a two-hour training session. There is no guarantee that the organization will continue to properly use (or use at all) a tool or software installed or downloaded during the training. OrgSec practitioners must be aware of these limitations, as insufficient training or support may lead to a false sense of security and can ultimately put the organization at a greater risk than they were to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAFETAG is meant to be a general framework.&lt;/strong&gt; The SAFETAG framework serves as a toolbox, or collection of relevant tools and activities that can be used to conduct an organizational security audit. When planning for an audit, the auditor must select which tools and activities are most relevant based on the local context, size of the organization, and resources available. Some activities may be too complicated or irrelevant. You do not need to complete every activity in the SAFETAG framework!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>IFF OrgSec Village: Day One</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-06-09-iff-osv-day1/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;iff-orgsec-village&#34;&gt;IFF OrgSec Village&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internews is hosting the virtual Internet Freedom Festival (IFF) Organizational Security Village throughout this week (June 8-12)! The event is bringing together security auditors, digital security trainers, and other experts and practitioners for a five-day program of over 20 community-led sessions exploring five major themes in organizational security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions on Day 1 centered around diverse approaches to OrgSec adopted by practitioners in the community. Highlights from Day 1 of the OrgSec village included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A co-creation session on making &lt;em&gt;Organizational Security Community Spaces more Useful, Inclusive, and Resilient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion on ways to &lt;em&gt;Scale Organizational Security Assistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A session on &lt;em&gt;Strategies to Avoid Dependency and Deliver Lasting Change&lt;/em&gt; through OrgSec interventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conversation around the &lt;em&gt;Importance of Long Term Support and Engagement&lt;/em&gt; beyond digital security assessments in delivering organizational change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways from the discussions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The goal of OrgSec work is to make itself obsolete!&lt;/strong&gt; While it is easy to focus on tangible outputs like audits or reports, most auditors and trainers prioritize increased internal organizational security expertise and decreased dependence on external security help. Effective strategies include finding digital security champions within organizations and building capacity in the surrounding community. Building the confidence and ability of those in the organizations to put digital security into practice is just as important as hardening their digital security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Security assistance is not being made available to those who need it the most.&lt;/strong&gt; In the US and globally marginalized communities facing the greatest threats are also those with least access to critical digital security resources (both human and financial). It is imperative to address this fact when designing programs and change the language we are using to be more inclusive of these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A security audit or assessment is just the beginning!&lt;/strong&gt; Most organizations need long-term support to make an effective change in their practices and harden their defenses against digital security attacks. Despite this, funding structures supporting current OrgSec work are not conducive to long-term engagement. Practitioners need to consider how to bake sustainability and long-term support into program design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-not-too-late-to-register&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not too late to register!&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Community Call for Feedback!!</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-05-13-safetag-community-call/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-05-13-safetag-community-call/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, we shared that we would be updating the visual identity of SAFETAG, including the development of a new logo, color-scheme, and iconography. We are excited to share that we  will be working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://showcase.dropbox.com/s/This-is-tafka-MX9NBtr2zTzngWhO2EVLp&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tafka&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a design collective based in Mexico, and are officially starting the re-design process!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-re-design-safetag&#34;&gt;Why re-design SAFETAG?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have decided to re-design SAFETAG to provide a more cohesive and recognizable brand. The new digital assets will be used across the website, interface (more details below), and all other SAFETAG documentation. Our hope is that this new design will make content more accessible for users, particularly new auditors that may have previously struggled with navigating through the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-interface-coming-soon&#34;&gt;New Interface (coming soon)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the re-design, we are working with a development team to build a new SAFETAG interface that is easier to use and more accessible for both new and experienced auditors. The new interface will allow auditors to generate “playlists,” or collections of audit activities, tailored to a specific type of organization or risk environment. These customized and shareable playlists can be stored for future reference or shared with other auditors working in similar contexts. We are expecting to launch the new interface during the late summer or early fall of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-need-you&#34;&gt;We need you!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure that the new design reflects the needs of the SAFETAG community, we would like to invite all SAFETAG users, both new and experienced, to share feedback with us. We will be holding two open community calls on &lt;strong&gt;May 19, 2020 at 10:30 am ET and another on May 21 at 9:00 am ET.&lt;/strong&gt; Please let us know you will be attending one of the calls by registering &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbcQm-IR0tUdC32T1dzRNxgEa_oAfMk9gNlcyNvkoTHgsTRw/viewform&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We will be sharing details for joining the call directly via email with those who RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the community feedback calls, we would also like to invite community members to complete a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_4r7JM8YDEj17h-IgPgXOM0PS2BGyMek1JLyW0wKHyBkAFQ/viewform&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;short survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This 20-question survey will allow us to collect any ideas and feedback you may have and provide space for those who may not be able to join one of the community feedback calls to share thoughts asynchronously. We look forward to hearing from you and incorporating your thoughts and feedback into this design process!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apply to Participate in Upcoming Cross-Regional Convenings!!</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-04-03-cross-regional-convenings/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-04-03-cross-regional-convenings/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, Internews will be hosting two Cross-Regional Convenings to bring together digital security trainers, SAFETAG auditors, usability and accessibility experts, and tool developers to map privacy and security tools being used by at-risk organizations and to identify concrete ways that we can support improvements to those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, we have worked with the Internet freedom community to develop a variety of activities for trainers to deploy during digital security trainings to collect tool-specific feedback and critical information about at-risk users. We have also compiled useful information on how to identify open source tools interested in feedback, connect with tool developers, and format and prioritize recommendations. All of these activities and resources can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Internews partner Okthanks also developed a set of activities to facilitate a participatory design and development process. Those activities can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/exploratorium&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploratorium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These activities are for the community and any feedback or additions to the collection (or Exploratorium) are highly appreciated. The Cross-Regional Convenings will build on this work, expanding the number of individuals trained in feedback collection and increasing the number of tool teams implementing usability and accessibility improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the convenings, attendees will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review and provide feedback on the UX Feedback Collection Guidebook, the Exploratorium, and other existing activities and resources;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop new content and resources focused on capturing feedback at the organizational level; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map the various tools that at-risk communities and organizations are using and their reasons for doing so; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document the specific challenges that organizations face, such as sharing passwords or using tools for collaboratively editing documents; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make meaningful connections with individuals across sectors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following these convenings, Internews will open a small pool of funding to support digital security trainers and SAFETAG auditors wishing to collect feedback within their communities, with an emphasis on trainers or auditors working long-term with at-risk organizations and communities. With funding support through this mechanism, trainings and audits will incorporate creative and effective feedback collection methods to obtain actionable feedback about the privacy and security tools being used in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, Internews will work with trainers and auditors to identify relevant open source privacy and security tools to receive funding to implement the specific usability and accessibility improvements requested by the at-risk communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, we are planning to hold certain sessions of the Cross-Regional Convenings virtually over the summer (June-July 2020). If it is safe to do so, we hope to facilitate the remaining sessions at two in-person engagements, hosted between August-October 2020. Participants will only be expected to attend one of the in-person convenings and all associated costs will be covered by Internews. We will continue to provide updates and potential dates and locations for the convenings as we have them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-apply&#34;&gt;How to Apply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in participating in these convenings, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMCH6GJRtMNhNniXHuqSPK1r2qpSVZI2rr5MxqPfROZcX3xw/viewform?usp=sf_link&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;apply here!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bridge Usability and Organizational Security at the Internet Freedom Festival&#39;s first-ever Organizational Security Village!</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-01-27-orgsec-village/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2020-01-27-orgsec-village/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Internews is pleased to host the Organizational Security Village at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://internetfreedomfestival.org/&#34;&gt;Internet Freedom Festival&lt;/a&gt; this year. This two-day event (April 23 and 24) will bring together digital security trainers, security auditors, and other experts and practitioners for lightning talks, interactive workshops, collaborative discussions, and relevant hands-on labs and skill-shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-usability-to-the-agenda&#34;&gt;Add Usability to the Agenda!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to some more traditional &amp;ldquo;OrgSec&amp;rdquo; ideas for this village; we are seeking specific user feedback on both the &lt;a href=&#34;https://SAFETAG.org&#34;&gt;SAFETAG framework&lt;/a&gt; (how it works, how the content is presented, etc.) and are also looking to identify critical usability gaps in organization-level security tools - what is needed and how are organizations currently managing secure collaboration needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please complete &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/AiLgB9PHdq3ka3Tt9&#34;&gt;this application&lt;/a&gt; to propose sessions or topics that you would like to explore further. Deadline for submission is &lt;strong&gt;February 28, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;. All selected submissions will be notified by March 20, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From the Guidebook: GitHub for Non-developers </title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-04-guidebook-github/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 13:50:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-04-guidebook-github/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/logos/GitHub_Logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;GitHub&#34; style=&#34;width: 40%; border: 0; float: right; padding: 1em;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful tool developers use for version control and storing their code in an open and transparent way. However, this platform is complex with many different features that can be daunting for the non-developer. The USABLE team has worked with partners to try to break down several GitHub features in a way that makes the most sense for non-developers, reviewing only what is needed to investigate a tool and to provide critical user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that many of these approaches also work fot GitLab and many other code management platforms!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three key ways that non-developers can use GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check if a project is active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To investigate who is contributing to the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To directly share feedback with developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before collecting feedback, it is essential that you make sure the project is still active and that someone is actively maintaining or updating the code. A quick search for a tool on GitHub can lead you to the project’s repository. From there, the “Insights” tab provides additional information about the authors contributing to the code, the date of the last release or update, as well as any outstanding issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers that have previously worked or are currently working on the project are identified as “Contributors.” The profiles of these developers can be found under the “Contributors” tab, which is under the larger “Insights” tab. Each profile captures the contributors work on the project over time, and any other projects or repositories that they work on. Additionally, some developers will include contact information on their profiles, such as their email address or Twitter handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub can also be used by non-technical users to &lt;strong&gt;submit feedback directly to developers&lt;/strong&gt; via issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An issue is a term GitHub uses primarily as a “bug tracker”, meaning if you encounter a problem with the software, you can submit an issue and the developers (who are in theory monitoring the issues in the queue) will address them according to their internal process and priority level. All issues are public, so this can also be a space to see what challenges or requests other users are submitting. More on GitHub issues can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.github.com/features/issues&#34;&gt;https://guides.github.com/features/issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From the Guidebook: Communication Channels for Sharing Feedback</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-04-guidebook-comms-channels/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 10:50:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-04-guidebook-comms-channels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After collecting or documenting user feedback, it is important to select the proper channel of communication for sharing it with the developer(s). Each tool team has a preferred channel for communication. Researching these channels in advance allows you to ensure that you are communicating with the developer or tool team in the most effective way possible. The USABLE team has compiled some of the main channels tool teams prefer to receive feedback or connect directly with users below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-app/In-tool&lt;/strong&gt;: Some tools also offer avenues to provide in-app or in-tool feedback. There may be a chat feature, quick survey, or entire page dedicated to collecting user feedback within the tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Via the tool’s website&lt;/strong&gt;: Some tools have specific instructions or contact preferences that they list on their website. Do your best to follow these instructions when you can; but also keep in mind that many of these instructions or forms presume that you are reporting a specific “bug” in the tool about something going wrong, as opposed to suggestions to improve the usability or request a new feature. They may not all be applicable or even possible to follow - and that is OK, but it is important to try to provide the data they request when they specify it or explain why you cannot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width: 40%; background-color: #B2CEE6; float:right; padding: 1em; margin: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub and other issue or ticket tracking systems&lt;/strong&gt;: Many tool teams store their code on GitHub (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;https://github.com&lt;/a&gt;). The platform can be used to identify which individuals are contributing to the code and to share feedback directly through the submission of “issues.” Other tools use other platforms to help them track, prioritize, and discuss issues and feature development (Tor, for example, has a very active issue system at &lt;a href=&#34;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query&#34;&gt;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query&lt;/a&gt;, and enigmail uses SourceForge for its system: https:// sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/bugs/).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email&lt;/strong&gt;: Tool teams typically have a general email account for the tool or project. Some also post the PGP key associated with the account so users can send encrypted emails. Individual developers may also post their personal email accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;/strong&gt;: Several tools have social media accounts, such as Twitter or Facebook, where they post updates and engage with users. Look on the tool’s website or in their profile on GitHub, but be respectful of developers who keep their personal social media accounts separate from their tool development work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>From the Guidebook: Tips for Communicating with Developers</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-04-guidebook-communicating-with-developers/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 09:50:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-04-guidebook-communicating-with-developers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that many non-technical people do not have experience communicating with developers, the USABLE team worked with partners to compile this list of give quick tips for engaging. Note, it is not mandatory to follow each item step-by-step. The list is meant to give a quick and overarching view of tried and true methods when communicating with the open source developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width: 40%; background-color: #B2CEE6; float:right; padding: 1em; margin: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&#34;USABLE conferences are the biggest opportunities we&#39;ve had to get usability feedback directly from impacted users, trainers, and communities.&#34;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -- Rob Hansen of Enigmail and GnuPG&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check to ensure someone is actively updating the project. If a project has not been worked on for several months, or even years, this should indicate the project is no longer active or the developers may be less receptive to feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always be respectful and highlight features that you appreciate or value, as well as improvements that could be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a personal connection with the developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a story or scenario to illustrate why your request/feedback is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain how the design change will impact real end-users, or how the current feature has endangered end-users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the proper channel to communicate with the developer. This may be via email, GitHub issues, or some other channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some tools have guides on what specific feedback they are looking for and what format they prefer. Research and try to follow these recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document the steps you took that led to the issue. This is important for developers, as they will try to repeat the problem. * Take screenshots or gifs of the problem. Write out a detailed description. Prepare a user story for the specific issue. Keep logs of how often the issue occurs or the number of people impacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know how to use GitHub, see if your issue or concern has already been documented. Offer specific suggestions around how the tool could be improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocate for more secure and user-friendly tools. Enlist other users to help make your case to the developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow-up with the developer. This can be a quick thank you or a general check-in on progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Launch of the UX Feedback Collection Guidebook</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-03-guidebook-launch/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-03-guidebook-launch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, we are excited to release a compilation of these activities and resources, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook&#34;&gt;UX Feedback Collection Guidebook: Integrating Feedback Collection from High-risk Users into Existing Training Practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the most at-risk communities around the globe rely on open
source privacy and security tools. However, these tools are often
designed, developed, and maintained by individuals or small teams who
have little to no access to their target audience — journalists,
activists, human rights defenders, and other high-risk groups. This
often results in tools that poorly fit the threats, challenges, and/or
accessibility or usability requirements of end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USABLE project aims to close this gap by establishing feedback loops
between the communities who make the tools and the communities who use
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, USABLE has worked with over 50 trainers from around the
globe, 11 designers and UX experts, and 7 open source tool teams who
build products that focus on privacy and security for high-risk
communities to develop and test feedback collection activities. The goal
was to identify straightforward and time-efficient activities and
resources that would allow digital security trainers to integrate
feedback collection into their existing training frameworks. When done
effectively, the process of capturing and sharing feedback can transform the design and
development of the most commonly used privacy and security tools for
high-risk users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/Guidebook-cover.png&#34; alt=&#34;UX Feedback Guidebook cover&#34; style=&#34;width: 40%; border: 0; float: right; padding: 1em;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidebook is broken down into four thematic sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part I: Collecting Feedback to Better Understand the User&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part II: Collecting Tool-specific Feedback During Trainings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part III: Collecting Feedback Outside of Trainings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part IV: Communicating with Developers and Tool Teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From background information to facilitation guides to editable
templates, the guidebook provides trainers and facilitators with the
resources required to effectively collect, synthesize, and share
valuable feedback from high-risk users with tool developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further details and the full guidebook can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/guidebook&#34;&gt;https://usable.tools/guidebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Q&amp;A with Accessibility Lab</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, we are taking some time to catch up with our UXFund grantees, and learn a little more about their organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qa-with-accessibility-labhttpsa11ylabcom&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with &lt;a href=&#34;https://a11ylab.com/&#34;&gt;Accessibility Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-how-did-you-become-involved-with-this-project-what-are-your-motivations-for-this-work&#34;&gt;Q: How did you become involved with this project? What are your motivations for this work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I became involved when I saw the challenges and barriers that my friends with disabilities had using the internet. My motivation is to increase awareness about digital divide and inclusion of people with disabilities, so they can have equal access to Information and Communication Technologies and better opportunities in education and employment.&lt;/p&gt;

Who else is working on the project (full-time, part-time, etc)? How often do you connect and via what channels?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Normally we are 6 people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;border: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pedro Bori&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Head of Training and Designer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;border: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;María Martínez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Trainer and Usability consultant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer and I are full time and the rest of the team is part time, depending of the budget and projects we have. Sometimes we have more people on the team, for example, more designers, more developers and more people with disabilities (visual and motor disability). We connect every day. Almost all is online, by mail, by phone, whatsapp, Jitsi Meet, etc. Sometimes we meet physically but not always is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-why-do-you-think-its-valuable-to-engage-with-users&#34;&gt;Q: Why do you think it’s valuable to engage with users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Because from the accessibility perspective, users with disabilities will offer the best feedback to understand their experience in the usability and accessibility of any digital content. A designer or developer will understand the importance of their work and see the difference between being able to use it or not at all independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--what-is-the-best-way-for-userstrainerstool-teams-to-connect-with-your-team&#34;&gt;Q:  What is the best way for users/trainers/tool teams to connect with your team?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USERS: testing and sharing feedback about the webpage, app or tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRAINERS: being updated about international standard and new technological solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TOOL [Developers]: we can work with any tool to see if it is accessible or not, from a technical and non-technical perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--what-role-do-trainers-play-in-the-feedback-loop-how-do-you-view-trainers&#34;&gt;Q:  What role do trainers play in the feedback loop? How do you view trainers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Trainers have a very important play because they share knowledge about international standard, best practices, solutions and other relevant information so more people can develop accessible websites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just about increasing awareness about the digital right of web accessibility, but to offer solutions, tools and knowledge to improve web accessibility and create accessible websites and apps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--has-your-team-ever-used-personas-to-inform-design-or-development&#34;&gt;Q:  Has your team ever used personas to inform design or development?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We always use personas to test accessible websites or make audits and offer feedback. Our personas are most commonly blind people and people with motor disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--where-can-people-look-to-learn-more-about-accessibility&#34;&gt;Q:  Where can people look to learn more about accessibility?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://a11ylab.com/landing-people&#34;&gt;Web Accessibility Campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/&#34;&gt;Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/&#34;&gt;Accessible Rich Internet Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--what-are-the-top-five-things-to-consider-when-designing-a-site-or-tool-with-accessibility-in-mind&#34;&gt;Q:  What are the top five things to consider when designing a site or tool with accessibility in mind?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide text alternatives for any non-text content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide alternatives for time-based media, like transcripts, captions, audio-descriptions and sign language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make all functionality available from a keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The visual presentation of text, images of text and user interface components must have enough color contrast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make forms with accessible structure and labels relationships for users with assistive technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--what-are-the-future-plans-for-your-team&#34;&gt;Q:  What are the future plans for your team?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue with our consultant services and trainings for private sector, government and universities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free or very low-cost trainings for final users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the accessibility of websites and apps considering the experience of users with disabilities as an awareness campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a digital accessibility observatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start providing digital accessibility certification:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To companies and government websites (through a civil organization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To individuals like designers and developers (through IAAP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue with networking sessions inviting people and companies that want to collaborate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an alliance with the federal office that reviews the implementation of accessible web content with the purpose to certify each government office with the law requirements of web  accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create video interviews and infomercials with the testimonies of people who have had the benefits of the web accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain the certification from the International Association of  Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) for all their team members:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competency (CPACC) for administrative staff and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) for technical personnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start providing information and content for other countries around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize the first “Global Festival of Universal Design and Digital Inclusion”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish our online course about Web Accessibility in Spanish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Q&amp;A with the KeePassXC team</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-02-qa-keepassxc/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-02-qa-keepassxc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, we are taking some time to catch up with our UXFund grantees, and learn a little more about their organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qa-with-keepassxc&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with KeePassXC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-what-is-your-tool-and-what-is-your-role&#34;&gt;Q: What is your tool? And what is your role?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; width: 50%&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://keepassxc.org/screenshots/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://keepassxc.org/images/screenshots/linux/screen_002.png&#34; style=&#34;border: 0; padding: 0px; margin: 0px&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of KeePassXC showing account selection features&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;main-caption small&#34;&gt;Screenshot from KeePassXC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://keepassxc.org/&#34;&gt;KeePassXC&lt;/a&gt; is an open source, offline password management tool that is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Our key features include the most secure encryption available on the market, Auto-Type technology, randomized password and passphrase generation, browser integration, and full compatibility with other KeePass-based tools. We also support several operating system integrations and advanced features for our more technical users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since forking from KeePassX in October 2016, we have released four major and fifteen minor versions that have introduced significant capability, usability, and security enhancements. Full source code, issue and feature tracking, and integration reviews are handled &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc&#34;&gt;openly on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I co-lead the project development and direction along with Janek Bevendorff (phoerious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-why-should-people-use-a-password-manager-how-can-users-use-kpxc-to-make-their-lives-easierbe-more-secure&#34;&gt;Q: Why should people use a password manager? How can users use KPXC to make their lives easier/be more secure?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; A password manager is necessary to ensure you have randomized and unique passwords for every service you log into. This is important because you don’t want a breach of one service to also compromise your security elsewhere. It is impossible to remember unique logins that are complex enough to be resistant to hacks. KeePassXC not only stores this information for you, in a secure way, but it also fills in that information for each site you use automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-how-did-you-become-involved-with-this-project-what-are-your-motivations-for-this-work&#34;&gt;Q: How did you become involved with this project? What are your motivations for this work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I had originally just wanted to bring the browser integration feature to the latest version of KeePassX since I was using it daily. However, it became clear that the original maintainer did not have the time to focus on the application and it was aging quickly. I made the decision to branch from that project, incorporate my work, and bring over all the pending bug fixes and features that the community had contributed over the years, but were never incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This created an outpouring of support and recognition from the large number of users who were excited to see their favorite tool get even better. I was deeply motivated by the energy and enthusiasm of the community, which has grown every year since we first launched. I am inspired by the diverse groups that use KeePassXC daily to keep their lives secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-how-large-is-your-team-who-else-is-working-on-the-project-full-time-part-time-etc-how-often-do-you-connect-and-via-what-channels&#34;&gt;Q: How large is your team? Who else is working on the project (full-time, part-time, etc)? How often do you connect and via what channels?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Our core team consists of six individuals who live all over the world; we are all volunteers and work on this project in our free time. Janek and I lead the project by curating our release roadmap and rigorously reviewing code submissions prior to acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have four feature maintainers who are largely responsible for their major contribution to the project. These include the browser extension, command line interface, and SSH agent. We also have a large community of beta testers and deployment specialists who help us roll out releases on a regular basis. It truly takes a small army to keep the project rolling due to our security-centric nature and wide distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-why-do-you-think-its-valuable-to-engage-with-users&#34;&gt;Q: Why do you think it’s valuable to engage with users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Our application was specifically setup to incorporate user feedback and best practices. The ‘C’ in KeePassXC stands for Community. Users provide us issue reports and feature requests daily. These directly inform development decisions and benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--what-is-the-best-way-for-users-to-share-feedback-with-your-team&#34;&gt;Q:  What is the best way for users to share feedback with your team?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Users should register a GitHub account, it is free, and submit an issue through our project page. If they do not want to do that we will accept feedback through our email at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:team@keepassxc.org&#34;&gt;team@keepassxc.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--how-has-feedback-previously-been-incorporated-into-development&#34;&gt;Q:  How has feedback previously been incorporated into development?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We have over 2,000 closed issues and 900 merged pull requests. These range from simple bug fixes to major new features. The vast majority have been submitted by our user base in both written and code formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q--has-your-team-ever-used-personas-to-inform-design-or-development&#34;&gt;Q:  Has your team ever used personas to inform design or development?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We have not specifically used personas, but we do consider the end user when implementing features. This is something we will investigate doing in the future as part of our pull request process for major features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-what-are-the-future-plans-for-the-project&#34;&gt;Q: What are the future plans for the project?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Our next major release is version 2.5.0 which incorporates several user interface and accessibility fixes. This release also includes significant improvements to the command line interface and browser integration plugin. The next major release will focus on user interface workflow and styling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UXFund: SecureDrop</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_securedrop/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_securedrop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://securedrop.org/&#34;&gt;SecureDrop&lt;/a&gt; is an open source software platform that allows secure sharing and communication between journalists and their sources. Under the UXFund, Internews contracted an individual UX designer to work with the SecureDrop team to support the creation of a user-friendly, integrated SecureDrop workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ongoing iterative testing of prototypes, the designer provided experience recommendations with many focused on accessibility such as updating the color palette and typography to improve contrast and legibility, making the header text more intuitive, and enabling keyboard navigation. Additional recommendations can be seen at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/issues/42&#34;&gt;https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/issues/42&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designer also met with the project team via video conference to present the workstation client visual design, including explorations for how to carry newly resolved branding into web user interfacess for the Source and Journalist experiences. A screenshot of the client prototype can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/securedrop_screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;SecureDrop interface&#34; style=&#34;border: 0; width: 100%; padding: 1em;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>UXFund: Mailvelope</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_mailvelope/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_mailvelope/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mailvelope.com/en&#34;&gt;Mailvelope&lt;/a&gt; is a free software for end-to-end encryption of email traffic which is integrated within browsers as an extension. Through this round of the UXFund, Mailvelope was able to release the latest version of the tool with user-experience (UX) and user-interface (UI) changes that were recommended by a team of UX designers as well as accessibility updates that were recommended by &lt;a href=&#34;https://a11ylab.com/&#34;&gt;Accessibility Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the maintenance updates they made through this grant include the ability for the user to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload and delete keys to the Mailvelope key server within the keyring UI,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the key password,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create revocation certificates and upload to key server,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change user ID, name, and email, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a new expiration date for the key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.f209.de/&#34;&gt;f209&lt;/a&gt;, a team of UX designers, provided Mailvelope with design proposals for the application and website, ultimately leading them to not just optimize certain parts of Mailvelope, but instead rebrand completely to provide one consistent and improved user experience. Taking these recommendations, along with those from Accessibility Lab’s audit reports, Mailvelope redesigned some of their major interfaces, including: the Mailvelope editor integration in Gmail with improved attachment handling, the file encryption UI, the Mailvelope website, and the extended key maintenance features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Mailvelope was able to reimplement the layer that is used to integrate with the mail provider website. For the users of mail providers such as Gmail, this has the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better performance&lt;/strong&gt;: Mailvelope requires less resources to scan the mail provider page for PGP messages. The detection is also much faster. Instead of an up to 2 seconds delay required to detect a message in the previous version, there is now an instant detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;: More mail providers are supported, and several message detection corner cases have been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant decryption&lt;/strong&gt;: Mailvelope will now instantly decrypt messages without additional user action, since the user’s private key is in the password cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved usability&lt;/strong&gt;: The editor button now has an animation and the words “Write secure email”, helping the user understand the functions of the button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file encryption user interface in the Mailvelope app has also been redesigned, providing a separate section for encryption and decryption in the top-level navigation. Text and file encryption have now been integrated into one UI, with the signing of data supported across all encryption processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using last quarters accessibility recommendations from Accessibility Lab, the Mailvelope team has also applied recommendations, improving accessibility and design of the Mailvelope website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mailvelope.com/en&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/Mailvelope_screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Mailvelope website&#34; style=&#34;border: 0; width: 100%; padding: 1em;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>UXFund: The Guardian Project</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_guardian/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_guardian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/&#34;&gt;The Guardian Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a global collective of software developers, designers, advocates, activists, and trainers who develop open source mobile security software and operating system enhancements. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/&#34;&gt;Orbot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a free software Proxy server project which allows Android users anonymity on the Internet. Orbot uses Tor to encrypt internet traffic and empowers other apps to use the internet more securely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through their UXFund grant, the Guardian project focused on improving the core efficiency and reliability of Tor running as a service within the Orbot app. Since receiving feedback and learning about the confusion existing users were experiencing on the “VPN” feature of Orbot, they worked to redesign the setup, configuration, and text used to introduce and describe the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Project worked with Okthanks to complete user stories and host listening groups with end-users via encrypted conference calls. The Orbot listening groups were created to provide a space for users to connect with designers and developers and inform them of their needs and concerns as users. The Guardian team selected users in countries where censorship or surveillance are a reality to participate in these calls and will be using the feedback to adapt Orbot to be more useful to these groups.These listening groups, along with Guardian’s market research, have helped inform the user stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the listening group findings, the design team created a new, “mini,” redesign of the Orbot app. After creating an interactive prototype, the team released the beta version of the orbotmini app, which is currently only 4.77 MB (eventually will be 3MB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/OrbotMini_Screenshot.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshots of the orbotmini beta app &#34;style=&#34;width: 60%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;*Screenshots of the orbotmini beta app.*
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working with Accessibility Lab, Guardian received a full accessibility audit of the Orbot app and website and have launched their new website using a static Hugo framework. You can view their new website at https://guardianproject.info, which uses a clean web template, enabling them to better implement and support accessibility requirements.

      <title>UXFund: KeePassXC</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_keepassxc/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-10-01-uxfund_keepassxc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://keepassxc.org/&#34;&gt;KeePassXC (KPXC)&lt;/a&gt;, a recipient of one of the UXFund subgrants, is an open source password manager that is maintained by a small group of volunteer developers. Through this grant, the team partnered with &lt;a href=&#34;https://a11ylab.com/&#34;&gt;Accessibility Lab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/&#34;&gt;Okthanks&lt;/a&gt; to include a significant number of usability and accessibility improvements in their two latest releases, &lt;a href=&#34;https://keepassxc.org/download/&#34;&gt;KeePassXC 2.4.0 and 2.5.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of the grant, Okthanks conducted a new-user impression study, collecting feedback from new users of the KeePassXC tool. This study led to recommendations for user-experience (UX) and user-interface (UI) improvements to make it easier for users to get started with KPXC. Accessibility Lab also evaluated and provided accessibility recommendations for the KPXC tool, website, and browser extension. With their 2.4.0 release in March 2019 and 2.5.0 release in July 2019, KPXC implemented several of these recommendations, along with community recommended UX improvements, such as improving the database creation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates and improvements made throughout the course of this grant included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KeePassXC-Browser Extension was improved to support screen readers, keyboard-only interaction, and scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KPXC contracted a developer to perform software development and testing of the KeePassXC-Browser extension, with a focus on implementing the accessibility improvements identified by Accessibility Lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KPXC finalized and released the “Getting Started” guide, with the focus of helping users without any experience understand how to use the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KPXC finalized and released the “User Guide,” which deep dives into the major features of KPXC and ensure users can discover and use critical privacy and collaborative features of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three maintenance updates to KeePassXC were released, including 6 GitHub pull requests for user experience updates and 7 * GitHub pull requests for user interface updates. These improvements were a direct result of community feedback and incorporating enhanced workflows suggested by the Okthanks team. Community feedback received also led to the KeePassXC-Browser * Extension update which improved user experience and baseline functionality. The “Getting Started” guide and “User Manual,” developed by the documentation writer contracted under the grant, were incorporated directly into the KeePassXC application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your organization? And what is your role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply Secure is a design nonprofit based in New York and Berlin. Our work focuses on building technology that centers the needs of vulnerable populations. We work with practitioners to expand their skill set around human-centered design while focusing on user safety and privacy. We share our tools and resources openly for the community to learn from and continue to adapt. I am our Program Manager, which means that I help with program operations and management, but also work with our projects and partners on their usability and design challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How large is your team? Who else is working on the project (full-time, part-time, etc.)? How often do you connect and via what channels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our core team consists of four people, and we have a network of people helping us with various aspects of our work shout-out to the amazing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sanssoucigroup.com/&#34;&gt;Sans Souci Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for providing on-demand ops support!). My colleagues Georgia, Molly and Ame all have a background in design and many years of experience in both the non-profit and corporate sector, as well as in academia. We are a remote team with an office in Berlin, where three of us show up most days. We connect daily either via Slack or video chat, and we really value our collaborative and yet independent style of working together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you think it’s valuable to engage with users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tools that don’t work for their users&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;don’t work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Engaging with users is a crucial part of user research, which is the first step to building tools that work for people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the best way for users/trainers/tool teams to connect with your team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can always be reached at &lt;a href=&#34;contact@simplysecure.org&#34;&gt;contact@simplysecure.org&lt;/a&gt;, but the best way to connect with us is to join our community of over 400 people interested in the intersection between design, security, open source, and human rights. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/what-we-do/slack/&#34;&gt;Join our Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has your team previously worked to incorporate feedback into the design or development process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think feedback can be incorporated in a variety of ways, from having a designated user researcher on the team to systematically writing up UX bug reports. The biggest challenge is to ensure that there are existing structures to incorporate feedback gathered from trainings and elsewhere. We have seen many teams, especially teams working in FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software), where there is no pipeline for user feedback. Moreover, many structures only allow for passive feedback gathering (in the form of issue trackers and incoming mail); very few teams implement active feedback gathering (user interviews, observation, testing), which often leads to more insights and better recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role do trainers play in the feedback loop? How do you view trainers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trainers are in the rare position of being close to users in high-risk contexts, in a way that tool developers often are not. More than that, they frequently witness first-time use of a tool, and can provide first-hand information on usability. This makes their insights extremely valuable! What I also really appreciate is that trainers are leaders in awareness- and capacity-building, and teach people skills rather than workflows. This has the potential to empower people in unknown and unsafe situations, where they can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily rely on a tool and have to take a more holistic approach. Needless to say: it&amp;rsquo;s a really hard but important job, and I&amp;rsquo;m humbled to know so many awesome and dedicated people working as trainers in our field!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has your team ever created or used personas to inform design or development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes! We love personas, and have written about them &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/blog/personas&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/blog/design-spot-design-security&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We think they are a crucial part of understanding who you are building your technology for. And we put them up everywhere to remind ourselves of why we are doing our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the future plans for your team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are thinking hard about scaling our impact and increasing the sustainability of our space overall. One thing we want to do is experiment with different formats to share our work. As a start, we are making educational videos and hosting monthly community calls about topics in our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/knowledge-base/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We are also working with funders to make sure usability work is an integral part of the funding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>UXFund: Accessibility Lab</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-25-uxfund_alab/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-25-uxfund_alab/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a11ylab.com/&#34;&gt;Accessibility Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, based in Mexico, is an organization that works with public and private companies as well as Civil Society Organizations to ensure the inclusion of people with disabilities in the digital world. They specialize in accessibility audits, assessing websites, tools, and resources to make sure they can be accessed by persons with disabilities. Through the UXFund, Internews aimed to expand their capacity to work directly with open source tool teams, providing guidance and specific recommendations to improve the accessibility of tools and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;completed-audits&#34;&gt;Completed Audits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the UXFund grant, Accessibility Lab completed audits and provided recommendations for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://keepassxc.org&#34;&gt;KeePassXC’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; website, desktop tool, and browser extension. Prioritized recommendations were applied and released in KPXC’s most recent update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mailvelope.com/en&#34;&gt;Mailvelope’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; website and browser extension. Prioritized recommendations were applied and released with their new website in July 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info&#34;&gt;Guardian Project’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Orbot tool website and Android application. Prioritized recommendations will be applied with their next website release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://securedrop.org&#34;&gt;SecureDrop’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; website and Source &amp;amp; Journalist Experience. Recommendations are expected to be applied in an upcoming release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                 &lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/AL_Textbox1.png&#34; alt=&#34;To complete these audits, Accessibility Lab worked with a mobility-impaired person who was able to verify the requirements related to motor disabilities and provide feedback on keyboard navigation requirements such as: skip content, focus order, visual focus, no trap focus, and more. They also worked with a visually-impaired contractor who could provide feedback using NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) for web pages, or the TalkBack screen reader for apps, focusing on forms, validations, status messages, and other information that should be communicated through these readers. &#34; style=&#34;width: 80%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Accessibility Lab project lead, Nancy Reyes, attended RightsCon Tunis, and was able to participate in the UX Help Desk alongside the USABLE team and organizations such as Simply Secure, EFF, and Access Now. At RightsCon, Nancy was able to connect with new organizations and explore future collaborations, such as one with Least Authority, which has plans to work with Accessibility Lab on a website audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next-for-accessibility-lab&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next for Accessibility Lab?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility Lab has begun collaborations with organizations such as the “Inclusion con Equidad” alliance, and “Fundacion Taiyari” alliance. They have also been working with the  “Federal Institute of Telecommunications” to provide training focused on creating accessible web content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They plan to continue their consultant services and trainings for the private sector, government, and universities, as well as providing digital accessibility certifications to companies and government websites, designers, and developers. They hope to provide information and content for other countries around the world, and organize the first “Global Festival of Universal Design and Digital Inclusion”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UXFund: Okthanks</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-24-uxfund_okthanks/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-24-uxfund_okthanks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okthanks, an organization focused on user experience and human-centered design, received a 9 month grant from the USABLE project to expand their capacity working with open-source privacy and security tool teams and digital security trainers around the globe. With this grant, Okthanks worked with tool teams to provide direct support in organizing user engagements, collect feedback from at-risk users, and guide future development of the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 9 months, Okthanks has worked with other UXFund grantees such as KeePassXC and the Guardian Project to achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;KeePassXC (KPXC)&lt;/em&gt;: The Okthanks team hosted an in-person study, bringing together 12 participants for a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/first-use&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Use&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; activity of KeePassXC. The goal behind the feedback session was to find how easy it was to use the tool and any barriers users faced when trying the tool for the first time. Feedback from this activity informed the KPXC team of necessary changes and led to the creation of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://keepassxc.org/quickstart/&#34;&gt;Quickstart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Guide, a resource designed to help first time users navigate the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian Project&lt;/em&gt;: A long-time partner of the Guardian Project, Okthanks worked with the team to create individual activities (translated into Spanish) for three tools they would be introducing in digital security trainings in Colombia- &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.witness.proofmode/&#34;&gt;ProofMode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.havenapp.main/&#34;&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guardianproject.info/apps/circulo&#34;&gt;Circulo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The theme of the trainings, which were hosted in the capital city as well as two rural communities, was focused on “creative ways to use your phone to keep yourself, your community, and your territory safe.” Once the trainings were complete, Okthanks created insight reports for each tool to share back with the Guardian Project and their respective partner organizations, Witness and Article 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;additional-engagements&#34;&gt;Additional Engagements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With funding from this grant, the Okthanks team was able to attend the Internet Freedom Festival in Valencia, Spain, where they co-facilitated a session with the USABLE project team, entitled “The Power of Personas.” During this session, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/persona-builder&#34;&gt;Persona Builder activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was piloted and the Okthanks team was able to receive feedback on other activities shared at the event, ultimately guiding activity updates and improvements for their new &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/exploratorium&#34;&gt;exploratorium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/UXFund_Okthanks_Textbox1.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Persona Builder activity was developed by the Okthanks team and facilitates a step-by-step process to create a user persona. This activity is useful for tool teams and digital security trainers hoping to better understand the needs of their users, and community members seeking to map their risks and behaviors. &#34; style=&#34;width: 50%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At IFF, Okthanks also deployed activities including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Witness &amp;amp; Guardian Project, ProofMode: First Use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenhost &amp;amp; Free Press Unlimited, Totem: First Impression Cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Center for Digital Resilience: First Impression Cards and I&amp;rsquo;m Interested Cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenArchive, Save: 5 minute flyer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 19 &amp;amp; Guardian Project, Circulo: My Story (Improved User Story)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IF Community, General understanding: Narrative cards and Persona activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following IFF, the Persona Builder activity was shared with the Tor UX designer for their use in creating personas for their team.  Okthanks also worked with Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited to generate activity ideas and present ways feedback could be gathered either through physical trainings or within their online tool, Totem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Okthanks team was also able to provide resources to Localization Lab for their Thai language sprint, including new activities “One Liners,” “Quick Reactions: What’s your Impression?” and “Emoji’s: Will you use it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Website Update and Exploratorium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last quarter, the Okthanks team focused on making changes and improvements to the frameworks and preparing content for the website. This included a review of all activities developed so far and updating them with any feedback received. They finalized the webpage layout, access to the individual activities, facilitator guides for every activity with instructions on how to run the activity, and for some provided a “no paper trail,” or digital deployment option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exploratorium is now live and all 12 activities and instructions are ready for download and use. A ‘Guiding Principles’ document was also created, outlining important considerations when conducting user research such as the threat model of a community, which can inform the appropriate way to deploy the activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional community resources are also linked on their website, and will continue to be updated as more resources become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-out-their-new-exploratoriumhttpsokthankscomexploratorium&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/exploratorium&#34;&gt;Check out their new Exploratorium!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>USABLE at the 2019 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS)</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-19-soups/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-19-soups/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE team facilitated a half-day workshop this past August at the 2019 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) in Santa Clara, California. The workshop, entitled “Designing for the Extremes of Risk,” was an interactive exploration of what it means to work with at-risk communities, particularly in the context of designing and developing privacy and security tools. The nearly 25 attendees represented a diverse range of professions, from academics to UX researchers to product teams and engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop began with a conversation about “high-risk” individuals and communities. After defining high-risk, the project team provided an overview of the USABLE project and an introduction to the UX Feedback Collection Guidebook (to be publicly released in October 2019). The half-day workshop concluded with four breakout sessions to dive deeper into relevant topics, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with High-Risk Communities: Barriers and Solutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trends and Themes Across Demographics of High-Risk Users,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a Community of Practice, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usable Security for Developers: Integrating UX into the Process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to organizing and facilitating this half-day workshop, the project team also attended an afternoon session organized by WIPS on Inclusive Privacy and Security. The WIPS team referenced USABLE personas during one of their activities and one breakout group used USABLE persona Marina from Russia as the template for their 3D storyboard creation. See photo below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/Marina_StoryBoar.png&#34; alt=&#34;Marina storyboard&#34; style=&#34;float: center; margin: 1em;  width: 50%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two days of the conference were focused on technical SOUPS sessions. For a quick summary of relevant papers and presentations, check out this blog post we co-authored with our partners in the usability space: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org/blog/SOUPS-2019&#34;&gt;https://simplysecure.org/blog/SOUPS-2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we have highlighted a few main take-aways from our engagements at SOUPS this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a product perspective, it can be difficult to identify at-risk communities, connect with them, and build the level of trust needed to collect accurate feedback. Using trusted intermediaries, such as digital security trainers, can provide tool teams with access to relevant feedback without jeopardizing the safety of at-risk communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tool teams can consider offering incentives (such as small stipends) for individuals who participate in user research. If offering incentives, be sure to research local implications for end users. For example, will accepting a stipend impact any government support that low-income participants may be receiving?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International events and UX convenings are a good entry point for interested parties to meet at-risk users and begin to build trust. It is helpful for people outside the existing Internet Freedom (IF) community to understand what events exist, who attends each one, and what the purpose of these events are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always be clear about what will be shared from meetings or gatherings (participant list, notes, attribution, etc.) and set clear ground rules from the beginning to foster a sense of trust among attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-design is most effective when it is implemented throughout the entire process. Utilize the co-design process not just for feature or tool development, but also developing the larger feedback collection process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User personas allow design and development teams to understand users without requiring direct access or communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User engagements or any feedback collection activities should always take place in a trusted environment or location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When designing alerts, it is important to consider the cross-cultural interpretation of the language/design. Images and graphics can be used to send a more universal message or serve users who may be illiterate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no universal catalog for usability security bugs, analogous to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) catalog for security threats. Are there ways to identify and/or automate the testing of usability failures by referencing “chaos engineering” style approaches (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering#10-18_Monkey)&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering#10-18_Monkey)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reframe “edge cases” as “stress cases.” Account for how people operate under stress, as this is a more universally applicable approach. Though levels of stress can differ, all users face stress at some point. (Credit to 18F staff, who originally shared this reframing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Q&amp;A with the SecureDrop Team</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-13-qa-securedrop2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-13-qa-securedrop2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, we are taking some time to catch up with our UXFund grantees, and learn a little more about their organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qa-with-securedrop&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with SecureDrop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-what-is-your-tool-what-is-it-used-for-and-what-is-your-role&#34;&gt;Q: What is your tool? What is it used for? And what is your role?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; SecureDrop, which is used by more than 65 media organizations around the world to communicate with sources who wish to remain anonymous (e.g., whistleblowers). I am the project lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-how-did-you-become-involved-with-this-project-what-are-your-motivations-for-this-work&#34;&gt;Q: How did you become involved with this project? What are your motivations for this work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I first became aware of SecureDrop initially as a user: at a Chicago based non-profit I co-founded - Lucy Parsons Labs - we installed SecureDrop in order to provide the most secure channel available for potential whistleblowers to send us information, primarily focused on the police accountability domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I got more involved with Freedom of the Press Foundation - the organization that currently stewards SecureDrop’s development. I became involved right around the time of the 2016 US presidential election, so it was a time when technologies protecting journalists and whistleblowers were getting significantly more interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how critical these tools can be to prevent journalistic sources from being identified is what keeps me motivated to work on SecureDrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-how-large-is-your-team-who-else-is-working-on-the-project-full-time-part-time-etc-how-often-do-you-connect-and-via-what-channels&#34;&gt;Q: How large is your team? Who else is working on the project (full-time, part-time, etc)? How often do you connect and via what channels?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Three teams at Freedom of the Press Foundation contribute to SecureDrop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core development team (4 people, including myself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The support team (2 people), which provides installation help and ongoing support for the 65+ media organizations using SecureDrop;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The digital security training team (4 people), which provides in-depth security training and consulting services to news organizations, including for SecureDrop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the project is supported by other members of our staff, including our project manager, our CTO, our Security Engineer, and a part-time UX Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-why-do-you-think-its-valuable-to-engage-with-users&#34;&gt;Q: Why do you think it’s valuable to engage with users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We need to make sure that we’re addressing our users’ real needs. What challenges do news organizations encounter when communicating with whistleblowers? How can SecureDrop support them in this process? The only way to answer those questions is to ensure that insights from user feedback, training, support, and user research feed back into the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a security product, it’s especially important that there is no disconnect between theoretical security and operational security practices. For example, SecureDrop uses an air-gapped viewing station for securely reviewing documents. If a journalist then takes a photograph of a document with their phone, that photograph of a sensitive document may be uploaded to a cloud or backup service without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging with users helps us identify these potential disconnects, and think about ways that we can address them through user experience improvements, training, documentation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-what-is-the-best-way-for-users-to-share-feedback-with-your-team&#34;&gt;Q: What is the best way for users to share feedback with your team?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; For news organizations and journalists using SecureDrop, we recommend that they get in touch with us via &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:securedrop@freedom.press&#34;&gt;securedrop@freedom.press&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc&#34;&gt;GPG key here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and request an account on our &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.freedom.press/&#34;&gt;support portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Because communications about production use of SecureDrop are inherently sensitive, it’s important to use a secure channel by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sensitive security issues, we offer &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bugcrowd.com/freedomofpress&#34;&gt;bug bounties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; via Bugcrowd, or researchers can send us an email at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:securedrop@freedom.press&#34;&gt;securedrop@freedom.press&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc&#34;&gt;GPG key here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For less sensitive communications, you can find us &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitter.im/freedomofpress/securedrop&#34;&gt;on Gitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and we encourage users to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/new/choose&#34;&gt;open issues on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, including for feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-how-has-feedback-previously-been-incorporated-into-development&#34;&gt;Q: How has feedback previously been incorporated into development?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; An example feature that is directly responsive to user feedback is the ability to administer the instance via the local network instead of using Tor which is how administrators access SecureDrop by default. This reduces the amount of time administrators spend working on their SecureDrop when it’s physically co-located in the newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback loop is often very fast when it comes to documentation changes: if a news organization stumbles over parts of our docs, it’s not uncommon for a fix to be incorporated a day or two later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-what-role-do-trainers-play-in-the-feedback-loop-how-do-you-view-trainers&#34;&gt;Q: What role do trainers play in the feedback loop? How do you view trainers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; FPF’s training team is integral to the success of SecureDrop. Given the complexity of the software and the security risks involved, engaging with journalists and administrators directly is the best way to ensure the system is used securely and effectively. The training team routinely shares insights with other SecureDrop team members, including in a debrief after any on-site with a news organization. The team also directly participates in documentation edits and reviews, updates to the threat model, UX discussions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FPF training team also creates &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://freedom.press/training/&#34;&gt;digital security guides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which frequently have relevance to SecureDrop, and which are cross-referenced in the SecureDrop documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-has-your-team-ever-used-personas-to-inform-design-or-development&#34;&gt;Q: Has your team ever used personas to inform design or development?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We currently don’t use personas, but are planning to do so in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q-what-are-the-future-plans-for-the-project&#34;&gt;Q: What are the future plans for the project?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We are working on a new project, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation&#34;&gt;SecureDrop Workstation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, based on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qubes-os.org/&#34;&gt;Qubes OS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The SecureDrop Workstation provides an integrated environment for connecting to SecureDrop and reviewing documents, using Virtual Machines to ensure documents are viewed in a secure, networkless environment that is destroyed after use.
This includes the development of a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client&#34;&gt;graphical client application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/&#34;&gt;Usable.tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has directly funded the work of one of our contributors, Nina Alter, on the user experience design and research for this effort, which has been instrumental in advancing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are planning to pilot the SecureDrop Workstation with select newsrooms later this year. If the pilot is successful, the SecureDrop Workstation has the potential to become a secure working environment for the most sensitive work journalists are engaged in—perhaps even including other communication tools that are commonly used for tip lines like Signal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USABLE at RightsCon Tunis</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-08-27-usable-at-rightscon2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-08-27-usable-at-rightscon2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, the USABLE team attended &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rightscon.org/past-events/tunis-2019/&#34;&gt;RightsCon 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Tunis. In addition to having face to face conversations and meetings with kay UX players in the Internet Freedom community, the team was able to co-facilitate a UX and Human Rights Zero Day event alongside &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accessnow.org/&#34;&gt;AccessNow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org&#34;&gt;Simply Secure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/&#34;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning of this full day event was focused on individual introductions and a mentoring/paired problem-solving activity, whereas the afternoon held participant-led breakout sessions with topics such as collecting user feedback, funding UX sustainability, queer interfaces &amp;amp; internet, and working in high-stress environments. The full-day event brought together a group of 30-35 designers, UX researchers and practitioners, tool team representatives, and digital security trainers to grow a community that advocates for rights-respecting and consent-based user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/RC2019_Quote.png&#34; alt=&#34;Quote from UX zero-day participant, The USABLE project by Internews is an example of how we can ensure continued support for usability work which would benefit users of open source tools as well as the creators of these tools&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: .5em;&#34;/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, we co-hosted a UX help desk at RightsCon, where RightsCon attendees were able to learn about UX organizations, receive resources from Okthanks and Accessibility Lab, and connect with individuals from these organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our program officer, Ashley, also facilitated a meetup session at RightsCon entitled “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rightscon2019.sched.com/event/Pvlh/creative-ways-to-support-diverse-tool-teams&#34;&gt;Creative Ways to Support Diverse Tool Teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,” where tool team representatives and community members met with donors to discuss their limitations and discuss potential solutions. The session was attended by smaller organizations and provided a good starting point for new solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USABLE Personas</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-13-usable-personas/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-13-usable-personas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE project has harnessed the knowledge of the digital security training community to build personas of high-risk users from around the globe. This has allowed the training community to play a critical role in communicating high-risk groups’ needs and use-cases for products directly to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often developers in the open source community are constrained in their understanding of users’ needs, making decisions based on their life experiences, assumptions, and their local environments. However, these all may be dramatically different than the experiences of high-risk groups using their products. Whether they are designing for a human rights activist in China or a journalist reporting on the frontlines in Crimea, for developers to design products that are useful and usable, they must better understand who their users are, their motivations, and their willingness to adopt such important security tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personas allow developers to better understand the threats, risks, and general activities of their ideal user. Personas pull out patterns of real users, and are not based on a single one person’s experience or circumstance. They are used to communicate a profile of characteristics, enabling developers to build a product based on real needs, rather than making assumptions. Personas are valuable in the design process because they allow for tool developers to make informed design decisions during the development process, facilitate the development of scenarios that simulate how an end-user would use the product, and push development teams to allocate resources based on real needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The USABLE Response</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-13-usable-response/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2019-09-13-usable-response/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;USABLE aims to create sustainable feedback loops among digital security trainers working with at-risk communities, open source tool developers, and user-experience (UX) and design experts. These successful feedback loops lead to more localized and usable tools, ultimately better equipping at-risk individuals and organizations to respond to existing and emerging digital threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities of security trainers around the globe are uniquely positioned to bridge high-risk civil society groups and tool developers. Trainers have extensive knowledge surrounding the threats faced by their communities, the risks they take, and the challenges they have with specific tools. Through a series of regional workshops, USABLE enhanced digital security trainers’ ability to integrate feedback collection activities within their existing trainings, while building up their capacity to communicate directly with tool developers about specific usability roadblocks hindering the adoption of important security practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the regional workshops, trainers put what they learned into practice, implementing Tool Feedback Sessions during their trainings and sharing this feedback with developers. By formalizing and expanding feedback collection, USABLE benefits at-risk users, trainers, and the open source developer community. Developers receive improved, higher-quality, and prioritized feature and tool modification requests, trainers have a direct path to improve the tools they train on, and voices of vulnerable populations are amplified. The result is more security and privacy tools that are easy-to-use for those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, USABLE has reached more than 400 end-users, jump-starting an important feedback loop that was previously missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of Trainings&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of End Users&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Pieces of Feedback Collected&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;User Personas Created&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;432&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;148&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, USABLE provided direct support to open source developer teams through two rounds of the UX Fund support, which offers targeted small grants for user-driven usability and accessibility improvements for open source digital security and privacy tools. As trainers continue to share collected feedback with developers, they not only improve developers’ understanding of their users, but also allow developers to capture and implement tool changes that result in more user-friendly and useful products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the USABLE project hosted its second UXForum, a multi-day event that brought together key communities including human rights groups, trainers, open source and private sector developers, and design experts to continue devising ways to scale and sustain these feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;personas&#34;&gt;Personas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personas, or profiles of end users, play an important role in the design process and allow developers to better understand community needs and facilitate the creation of user stories and more concrete use-cases for their products. In some of the most challenging security environments in the world, understanding the users capacity, threats, risks, and strengths can be difficult. The USABLE project has harnessed the knowledge of the digital security training community to build personas of high-risk users from around the globe. Learn more about USABLE Personas here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USABLE at IFF 2019</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-iff-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:50:48 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-iff-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE team attended the 2019 Internet Freedom Festival in Valencia, Spain. During the week, the team connected with digital security trainers, open source tool teams, and user-experience (UX) experts to discuss past, current, and future USABLE work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USABLE partnered with Okthanks to co-facilitate a session entitled “The Power of Personas.” The one-hour session provided a general overview of user personas and featured multiple examples, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/personas&#34;&gt;USABLE personas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://okthanks.com/blog/peronaslatin-america&#34;&gt;Okthanks personas&lt;/a&gt;. The remainder of the session focused on the process of creating user personas, demonstrated via a group activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Persona Builder activity was developed by the Okthanks team, and facilitates a step-by-step process to create a user persona. This activity is useful for tool teams and digital security trainers hoping to better understand the needs of their users, and community members seeking to map their risks and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USABLE at ILGA World</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-ilga-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:50:48 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-ilga-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE team attended ILGA World 2019, a bi-annual convening of LGBTQIA advocates and funders from all over the globe. Attending this conference allowed the USABLE team to meet with LGBTQI users, discuss the tools that are currently being used in the field, and better understand the threats that this particular community is facing in different parts of the world. Ultimately, this information shapes the tool teams that the USABLE team works with and expand the network of at-risk users with whom the project team can connect relevant developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In partnership with Grindr for Equality, the USABLE team co-organized a session entitled “Protecting Ourselves in a Digital World: The Basics of Digital Security and Online Safety.” The first component was a quick activity designed to capture current practices, threats, and questions of the community members in attendance. Participants were given three different colors of sticky notes and asked to spend 3-5 minutes documenting the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What tools or practices are you currently using to protect yourselves online?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the current threats facing you or your community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What questions do you have about digital security?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second component of the session, the USABLE team provided attendees with five simple steps they could take immediately to improve their digital hygiene. Azza Sultan, Associate Director at Grindr for Equality, then briefly presented the current security features offered by Grindr, as well as an overview of future features that they hope to develop soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final component required the attendees to divide into two smaller groups. One group focused on providing tool-specific feedback on Jitsi Meet. Attendees used the task-ranking worksheet developed during the regional UX Workshops to document their thoughts and feedback. The second group focused on providing feedback on Grindr’s security features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session was very well attended and everyone repeatedly voiced the need for more conversations around digital security in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh: &#34;Habibur Rahman Sujon&#34;</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/personas/bd_sujon/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:15:28 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/bd_sujon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habibur is in his twenties and identifies as a &lt;strong&gt;Muslim gay&lt;/strong&gt; man. He lives in a small town where he must constantly hide his sexuality. Recently, Habibur went to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, to attend a party for gay men. Police &lt;strong&gt;raided&lt;/strong&gt; the party and he and some of his friends were &lt;strong&gt;arrested&lt;/strong&gt;. The police outed them as gay men in front of the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habibur has an &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;anonymous&amp;rdquo; Facebook profile&lt;/strong&gt; that he uses to connect with other gay men. He is an active member of a closed Facebook group for gay Bangladesh men. He often &lt;strong&gt;attends events&lt;/strong&gt; that are posted in this group. Many people do not have access to a smart phone in his remote village, so he relies on Facebook groups to stay connected to other people in the LGBT community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habibur needs to be able to &lt;strong&gt;connect&lt;/strong&gt; with other members of the LGBT community, without fearing for his safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is interested in learning more about how to &lt;strong&gt;safely&lt;/strong&gt; use online dating tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habibur&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;identity was revealed&lt;/strong&gt; when he was &lt;strong&gt;arrested&lt;/strong&gt; during the raid of a party. Bullying and social harassment increased significantly following this incident, particularly within his university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGBT people are extremely &lt;strong&gt;vulnerable&lt;/strong&gt; when using social media or dating applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the risk mitigation materials that currently exist are only available in English. Habibur only speaks Bangla and therefore has &lt;strong&gt;limited resources&lt;/strong&gt; available to protect himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habibur owns a smart phone and knows how to use &lt;strong&gt;mobile applications&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He understands the basics of the Internet and he is able to &lt;strong&gt;send and receive emails&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I &lt;strong&gt;safely navigate&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook groups and dating applications for the LGBT
community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there &lt;strong&gt;risk mitigation materials&lt;/strong&gt; available in my native language of Bangla?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh: &#34;Tabassum&#34;</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/personas/bd_tabassum/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:15:28 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/bd_tabassum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabassum identifies as a &lt;strong&gt;lesbian&lt;/strong&gt; and has recently become an active voice for the rights of the LGBT community in Bangladesh. During the day, she works as a clerk at a local bank. She volunteers at an &lt;strong&gt;unregistered&lt;/strong&gt; LGBT rights organization. She also works with other activist groups for local and international &lt;strong&gt;advocacy&lt;/strong&gt;. She is out to a few of her friends, but not to her colleagues or family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to conduct meetings with other LGBT activists and the community, Tabassum needs to rely heavily on &lt;strong&gt;messaging applications&lt;/strong&gt; like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. She also uses her personal email regularly to communicate with ally organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabassum warnts to &lt;strong&gt;advance the LGBT rights movement&lt;/strong&gt; in Bangladesh by repealing Section 377.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also wants to &lt;strong&gt;raise awareness&lt;/strong&gt; and implement sensitization programs designed to create an accepting and inclusive society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homosexuality is &lt;strong&gt;illegal&lt;/strong&gt; in Bangladesh and LGBT activists can be &lt;strong&gt;arrested&lt;/strong&gt; by authorities according to Section 377 of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been reports that activists are under &lt;strong&gt;digital surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; from both the government and religious militant groups. These activists are being &lt;strong&gt;tracked&lt;/strong&gt; through social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabassum has a strong peer activist &lt;strong&gt;network for support&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knows which communication tools use &lt;strong&gt;encryption&lt;/strong&gt; and which do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She always meets other activists in &lt;strong&gt;public places&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;secure home&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know if I am under &lt;strong&gt;surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I stop information from being &lt;strong&gt;leaked&lt;/strong&gt; to other people?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>China: &#34;L. N.&#34;</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/personas/cn-ln/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.N. is in her early 20s, and is outgoing and charismatic. She lives in a major metropolitan area in &lt;strong&gt;mainland China&lt;/strong&gt;, and is a recent college graduate with many social connections; fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, and proficient in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. N. is a key member of an active &lt;strong&gt;women’s rights group&lt;/strong&gt; in China that has gained national and international media attention for some of its activities. She is committed to activism aimed at &lt;strong&gt;promoting the social and cultural change&lt;/strong&gt; necessary to bring about &lt;strong&gt;equal rights for women in China&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has come &lt;strong&gt;under pressure&lt;/strong&gt; to get married. Her resistance to this this pressure found expression in several videos that she co-produced with her group and posted on WeChat. These &lt;strong&gt;videos were widely shared&lt;/strong&gt; and led to a larger conversation throughout social media on the topic of women’s place in Chinese society. This attention has caused L.N., as well as members of the rights group, to come under &lt;strong&gt;closer scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt; by the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing ability to speak freely and &lt;strong&gt;advocate&lt;/strong&gt; for women&amp;rsquo;s rights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining &lt;strong&gt;social connections&lt;/strong&gt; with network of fellow activists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding &lt;strong&gt;secure communication tools&lt;/strong&gt; that work reliably to share with networks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activism brings constant and sophisticated surveillance, and can lead to restrictions on freedom of movement and association, including loss of employment and &lt;strong&gt;imprisonment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital devices are often confiscated with sensitive data, media, and private personal networks exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social isolation&lt;/strong&gt; and related depression stem from an inability to communicate privately, and a real fear that friends and family will also be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly trained on digital security tools and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducts highly sophisticated, thoughtful &lt;strong&gt;analysis of threats and choice of tools&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly savvy on &lt;strong&gt;operational security&lt;/strong&gt; and maintains separate mobile devices for regular activities for secure conversations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I communicate with individuals not already on secure communication channels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there secure tools that &lt;strong&gt;do not require VPN&lt;/strong&gt; to access?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I &lt;strong&gt;collaborate&lt;/strong&gt; securely with inner circle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I protect my data - on my phone and my computer - against &lt;strong&gt;confiscation&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z. W. recently &lt;strong&gt;posted an article&lt;/strong&gt; perceived as &lt;strong&gt;critical of government authorities&lt;/strong&gt; about a land-grab case occurring on the outskirts of a town in his hometown province. Due to Z.W.’s international connections, previous political statements he has made, his influential position as an academic, and the popularity of the current article he wrote, he was recently &lt;strong&gt;visited by government authorities&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;detained for questioning&lt;/strong&gt;. Several suspicious activities—including &lt;strong&gt;phishing emails&lt;/strong&gt;, and questions from the authorities directed to him about topics not widely known by others—make him certain he is under &lt;strong&gt;active surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;. He is currently investigating moving his family out of the country to ease pressures and is exploring opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ability to &lt;strong&gt;lock down his accounts&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent further surveillance, without raising his profile or drawing attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing and downloading secure tools and applications &lt;strong&gt;could be considered a criminal offence&lt;/strong&gt; due to new NGO and other related laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance of network activity&lt;/strong&gt; and digital devices confiscated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imprisonment, torture&lt;/strong&gt;, and the mental and physical health issues afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained on digital security tools and techniques; will implement techniques and tools if they work reliably, are usable (i.e., meet the &lt;strong&gt;basic usability standards&lt;/strong&gt; offered by tools such as WeChat, OneDrive, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I maintain social connections with my international network without secure communication methods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I convince my personal networks to use recommended secure communication tools (e.g., PGP, ChatSecure, Jitsi, etc) when these tools are considered &lt;strong&gt;too onerous&lt;/strong&gt; to setup or so &lt;strong&gt;unreliable&lt;/strong&gt; in functionality and service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses technology to &lt;strong&gt;communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with his colleagues, family, and friends. He also uses his &lt;strong&gt;mobile device&lt;/strong&gt; to record interviews and take pictures. Yasmany has grown accustomed to habitual &lt;strong&gt;harassment&lt;/strong&gt; from the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasmany needs to &lt;strong&gt;protect&lt;/strong&gt; himself and his stories from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited internet connectivity&lt;/strong&gt; and expensive data plans restrict Yasmany&amp;rsquo;s options when it comes to communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the computers he has access to have government &lt;strong&gt;spyware&lt;/strong&gt; that can track and record both online and offline activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the subject of &lt;strong&gt;raids&lt;/strong&gt; and sometimes his devices are searched at &lt;strong&gt;security checkpoints&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He makes sure he does not disclose &lt;strong&gt;sensitive information&lt;/strong&gt; in calls and text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He always &lt;strong&gt;updates&lt;/strong&gt; the software on his devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husna is an Indonesian woman in her mid twenties. She is an advocate for both &lt;strong&gt;freedom of expression&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;religious freedom&lt;/strong&gt;. For many years, she has worked on issues related to peace building, deradicalization, and journalism that supports the peace process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses social media to &lt;strong&gt;spread messages and information&lt;/strong&gt; to the general public. She also uses social media to &lt;strong&gt;coordinate activities&lt;/strong&gt; for different minority rights groups. The various groups are using Facebook, including Facebook Messenger, to coordinate their activities. The groups use Twitter to &lt;strong&gt;gain more public interest and support&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husna hopes for a better society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hopes that Indonesia will protect &lt;strong&gt;pluralism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to make sure that the government does not pass &lt;strong&gt;discriminatory policies&lt;/strong&gt; against minority religions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kenya: &#34;Alexandria Christian&#34;</title>

      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/ky_alexandria/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandria is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She is married and in her late twenties with a young child. She is a &lt;strong&gt;lawyer&lt;/strong&gt; by profession, but is also a &lt;strong&gt;champion of women&amp;rsquo;s rights&lt;/strong&gt;. She has been very vocal about FGM and has received some backlash for her activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of her anti-FGM work, Alexandria uses an application that enables volunteers to rescue young girls and relocate them. Alexandria is responsible for &lt;strong&gt;coordinating the volunteers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be able to &lt;strong&gt;track&lt;/strong&gt; the movement to my volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need an application which has an &lt;strong&gt;emergency button&lt;/strong&gt; for when there is no time to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandria&amp;rsquo;s child has been downloading apps on her phone without her knowledge. The downloaded software included &lt;strong&gt;malware,&lt;/strong&gt; which &lt;strong&gt;compromised sensitive information&lt;/strong&gt; stored on her device. The malware is also capable of downloading and installing other apps and can do so without detection. Alexandria does not know how much information has been &lt;strong&gt;leaked&lt;/strong&gt; so far, but the volunteers are vulnerable to attacks since their identities have been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandria makes sure that her software is always updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also makes sure that all volunteer files are &lt;strong&gt;encrypted&lt;/strong&gt; and is able to use the application to spread her message and get more people involved in anti-FGM efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I still &lt;strong&gt;safely&lt;/strong&gt; use my phone after deleting all the apps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I do to &lt;strong&gt;avoid&lt;/strong&gt; such incidents in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

She also trains activists and local communities on skills for adopting strategic non-violence and movement building to affect social change. She works as an &lt;strong&gt;IT assistant&lt;/strong&gt; for an organization that promotes environmental rights. Recently, the organization was hit by &lt;strong&gt;ransomware&lt;/strong&gt; and they lost a lot of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses a &lt;strong&gt;laptop for work and trainings&lt;/strong&gt; and uses &lt;strong&gt;bitlocker and Veracrypt&lt;/strong&gt; to encrypt files and drives. She makes sure to use secure plug-ins in browser to enhance security. She also uses a cellphone daily and occasionally uses &lt;strong&gt;social media.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary wants to learn more about ethical hacking in order to help human rights defenders better protect their systems. Since her organization was recently attacked by ransomware, she wants to make sure she has the best antivirus possible to &lt;strong&gt;protect their network and data.&lt;/strong&gt; She would like to &lt;strong&gt;strengthen her organization&amp;rsquo;s IT policies,&lt;/strong&gt; including back up procedures, to prevent this from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)&lt;/strong&gt; attacks have been happening to other Human Rights Organizations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spam and phishing&lt;/strong&gt; emails and SMS messages are often received by members of her organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical security&lt;/strong&gt; is a concern, as office and home break ins are common in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary is able to train others in digital security, including those in her organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses &lt;strong&gt;file encryption and a password manager&lt;/strong&gt; to store strong passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has a &lt;strong&gt;strong technical background,&lt;/strong&gt; and can install and configure different operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can &lt;strong&gt;internet of things&lt;/strong&gt; devices be secured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses his &lt;strong&gt;computer and cell phone&lt;/strong&gt; daily, and uses &lt;strong&gt;KeePassXC&lt;/strong&gt; to manage his passwords and &lt;strong&gt;Tresorit&lt;/strong&gt; to back up the organization&amp;rsquo;s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; of phone calls and the hacking of organization&amp;rsquo;s online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;physical security&lt;/strong&gt; is at risk, as targeted office break-ins are common in his city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;laptop and phone may be stolen&lt;/strong&gt; during a break-in or robbery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;

His day to day activities include researching the possible dangers that industrial waste can cause to humans and the environment. He lives with his wife, two sons, and one daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter uses a &lt;strong&gt;laptop for work&lt;/strong&gt; daily, and a cellphone to communicate with colleagues as well as his family. He uses &lt;strong&gt;dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; to store findings from the field, and uses &lt;strong&gt;Skype&lt;/strong&gt; often to communicate with colleagues and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter&amp;rsquo;s biggest concern is the &lt;strong&gt;privacy&lt;/strong&gt; of his patients. He wants to make sure that he is using a &lt;strong&gt;secure application&lt;/strong&gt; that can store the details of patients securely, in order to &lt;strong&gt;protect their privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; He would also like to have an application that can monitor the supply of government drugs in hospitals to ensure that they are adequately stocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an environmentalist, he is at risk of being &lt;strong&gt;targeted and cyber-bullied&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If his &lt;strong&gt;devices are stolen,&lt;/strong&gt; all of his research data will be at risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a healthcare professional, he is at risk of &lt;strong&gt;patients&amp;rsquo; data leaking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a &lt;strong&gt;great communicator,&lt;/strong&gt; and can make presentations for those in his community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the &lt;strong&gt;best tool to encrypt my data&lt;/strong&gt; on my computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lara is a Lebanese woman in her late twenties. She works as a &lt;strong&gt;journalist&lt;/strong&gt; and is also a &lt;strong&gt;well-informed activist&lt;/strong&gt;. She stays up-to-date on all current events and the latest news updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of her activism, she has been &lt;strong&gt;targeted&lt;/strong&gt; by the government and other entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses &lt;strong&gt;chat applications&lt;/strong&gt; like WhatsApp to communicate with her colleagues and connect with sources for her reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She needs to &lt;strong&gt;communicate securely&lt;/strong&gt; with her contacts and sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to &lt;strong&gt;better understand&lt;/strong&gt; how to safely use the applications she is already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has previously been the target of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could be &lt;strong&gt;imprisoned&lt;/strong&gt; as a result of defamation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes bold articles that &lt;strong&gt;educate&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;inspire others&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knows that unencrypted apps are the most &lt;strong&gt;vulnerable&lt;/strong&gt; in terms of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt; to use WhatsApp?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there &lt;strong&gt;another application&lt;/strong&gt; that I should be using for secure communication?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mexico: &#34;Maria&#34;</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/personas/mx-m/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:15:28 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/mx-m/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria is in her mid 30’s and is passionate in &lt;strong&gt;advocating for the rights of people with disabilities&lt;/strong&gt; in Mexico. She has been &lt;strong&gt;blind since she was very young&lt;/strong&gt; and faces a slew of accessibility challenges when using technology in her work and personal life. She must use a &lt;strong&gt;screen reader&lt;/strong&gt; to navigate her laptop and mobile devices, using a free and open-source version for Windows called, NVDA, and the built-in reader for iPhone, called, VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria and her colleagues face &lt;strong&gt;unique privacy and security concerns&lt;/strong&gt; both as activists and as persons who are blind because their &lt;strong&gt;inability to autonomously handle their most sensitive information&lt;/strong&gt; makes it impossible to handle such information securely. They are also more susceptible to other forms of digital attacks, as &lt;strong&gt;software is not consistently accessible&lt;/strong&gt; and navigable –- making it hard to pinpoint or identify abnormal activity sometimes on their devices (e.g. pop-ups, advertisements vs malware and viruses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance accessibility for all persons with disabilities through &lt;strong&gt;public advocacy&lt;/strong&gt; and policy changes in both the public and private sectors and through the &lt;strong&gt;promotion of accessibility standards&lt;/strong&gt; and testing products using the free and open-source screen reader, NVDA and VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a strategy and build the capacity of users with disabilities to &lt;strong&gt;prevent misuse of their data&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;personal rights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From digital security tools to normal tasks like checking bank statements, online shopping, or captchas; &lt;strong&gt;tools that are inaccessible are not usable.&lt;/strong&gt; This requires Maria to rely on and &lt;strong&gt;share private information&lt;/strong&gt; with family and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of information, fraudulent sites, malware, and webcam activation can happen without accessible alerts informing the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people with disabilities cannot complete tasks online, they must go to a location in-person, which can lead to physical threats due to infrastructure problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very &lt;strong&gt;comfortable with technology&lt;/strong&gt; and developing ways to &lt;strong&gt;work around accessibility problems&lt;/strong&gt; to accomplish tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committed to supporting the rights of persons with disabilities and increasing awareness of these accessibility issues in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in fostering a community of people with disabilities with whom to share experiences and ideas about improvements that can be made to &lt;strong&gt;improve technologies and make them accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I determine which websites and tools are accessible and secure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a security tool is not accessible, what are my best alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who can I contact about making this tool more accessible or if it is not working properly with NVDA or VoiceOver?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chumi is a &lt;strong&gt;lesbian&lt;/strong&gt; woman in her mid thirties. She grew up in a small town in Nepal, but now lives in the capital and works at an organization focused on advancing the &lt;strong&gt;rights of LGBT people&lt;/strong&gt;. Her organization advocates for gender equality and LGBT inclusive environments around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses Facebook, WhatsApp, and email to &lt;strong&gt;communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with community members, &lt;strong&gt;collect stories&lt;/strong&gt; from the community, provide real-time &lt;strong&gt;counseling&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;share legal updates&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wants to make others &lt;strong&gt;aware&lt;/strong&gt; of laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to &lt;strong&gt;protect&lt;/strong&gt; herself, the people she works with, and her information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has received &lt;strong&gt;death threats&lt;/strong&gt; due to her advocacy for the LGBTI community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her &lt;strong&gt;personal information&lt;/strong&gt; is on the internet and is published frequently by the media, which means other people have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is &lt;strong&gt;harassed&lt;/strong&gt; online because of her LGBTI identity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maya is a Nepalese woman in her early thirties. She is an &lt;strong&gt;information advocate&lt;/strong&gt;, an avid researcher, and is very active on Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is a well-known journalist in Nepal with many Twitter and other &lt;strong&gt;social media&lt;/strong&gt; followers. She primarily writes about &lt;strong&gt;politics&lt;/strong&gt;, sharing news and tweets related to political events or incidents happening in the country. Often times, she investigates and reports on her stories by physically going to the location of the incident or where the event is taking place, putting her at risk of &lt;strong&gt;physical harm&lt;/strong&gt;. When she publishes her stories, many times they are seen as &lt;strong&gt;sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;controversial&lt;/strong&gt; in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maya believes in the &lt;strong&gt;right to information&lt;/strong&gt; and is therefore committed to sharing sensitive information with the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she has already been a victim of violence, she prioritizes the &lt;strong&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; of herself as well as those she works with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She often shares &lt;strong&gt;sensitive information&lt;/strong&gt; about important and powerful figures in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She covers &lt;strong&gt;controversial issues&lt;/strong&gt; from corruption to migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She takes the same route every day. She is concerned that she will be &lt;strong&gt;stalked or harassed&lt;/strong&gt; on her commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her devices could be &lt;strong&gt;confiscated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maya has strong research skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is known by many as a pioneer of the right to information and is regarded as one of the most &lt;strong&gt;credible sources&lt;/strong&gt; in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses her Android phone for public uses and her iPhone for personal uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I &lt;strong&gt;protect my devices&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I have &lt;strong&gt;free mobility&lt;/strong&gt; despite being very active on social media?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I &lt;strong&gt;protect information&lt;/strong&gt; about myself and my friends?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esteban is a &lt;strong&gt;journalist&lt;/strong&gt; in his mid-twenties. He works at a small newspaper in Managua, Nicaragua. He reports on thematic issues, often using &lt;strong&gt;public transportation&lt;/strong&gt; to meet with sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a journalist, he relies on technology to &lt;strong&gt;communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with his sources. He wants to improve his digital security to ensure that he is not endangering himself or those he interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esteban needs a &lt;strong&gt;secure chat&lt;/strong&gt; platform to use when communicating with his sources, many of whom are people at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wants to be sure that his &lt;strong&gt;data and conversations&lt;/strong&gt; are not revealed to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esteban&amp;rsquo;s sources have &lt;strong&gt;limited access&lt;/strong&gt; to the internet and little knowledge about safe applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esteban and his sources use devices with &lt;strong&gt;low storage&lt;/strong&gt; capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esteban has &lt;strong&gt;connections&lt;/strong&gt; within the technological community, including with developers and bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is constantly &lt;strong&gt;up-to-date&lt;/strong&gt; with new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What applications will allow me to &lt;strong&gt;securely communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with my sources?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there tools that are &lt;strong&gt;easy to use&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marina is in her mid-thirties and works as an activist, blogger, and local community organizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses different technologies to post about local issues, to &lt;strong&gt;communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with fellow activists, and to &lt;strong&gt;organize protests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She often takes photos to post on social media and has organized &lt;strong&gt;petitions&lt;/strong&gt; that are sent to local administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants her voice to be heard by the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also wants to use tools that are &lt;strong&gt;easily accessible&lt;/strong&gt; for other activists and community members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local authorities launch &lt;strong&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/strong&gt; and employ trolls and hackers against her Facebook account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police can &lt;strong&gt;arrest&lt;/strong&gt; Marina and &lt;strong&gt;confiscate&lt;/strong&gt; her phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her followers and supporters could face &lt;strong&gt;persecution&lt;/strong&gt; if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is knowledgeable about &lt;strong&gt;social networks&lt;/strong&gt; and social applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is &lt;strong&gt;internet savvy&lt;/strong&gt; and is fluent in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I prevent the identities of supporters from being &lt;strong&gt;leaked&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I protect my Facebook, email, and IM from hackers and prevent them from being &lt;strong&gt;blocked&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasha is in his early thirties and works as a systems administrator at a civil society organization. He is very &lt;strong&gt;skeptical&lt;/strong&gt; and has a &lt;strong&gt;critical approach&lt;/strong&gt; to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He relies on technology to keep his organization &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work, he sometimes attends concerts, plays computer games, or hangs out with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he would never show it, he is an activist and he believes it is his duty to keep the organization &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes that everything should be very well &lt;strong&gt;organized&lt;/strong&gt; and work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His organization works on politically sensitive issues li1ke &lt;strong&gt;hacking, protests, eavesdropping, and provocations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-government youth movements are regularly &lt;strong&gt;verbally attacking&lt;/strong&gt; his colleagues and sometimes unexpected office visits from pro-government stations occur. Sasha&amp;rsquo;s colleagues are not tech-savvy and they often make a lot of &lt;strong&gt;critical digital security mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is skilled with technology and views everything through a critical lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has access to his entire organization&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;network&lt;/strong&gt;, which he set up by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I &lt;strong&gt;teach&lt;/strong&gt; all of my organization&amp;rsquo;s employees better digital security practices (use of &lt;strong&gt;strong passwords&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;2-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She relies on her phone and computer to &lt;strong&gt;stay connected&lt;/strong&gt; with the community and to &lt;strong&gt;store important data&lt;/strong&gt;. She also uses Skype to communicate with women remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on these issues makes her a target of phone tapping, email hacking, and home raids. If targeted, her &lt;strong&gt;data could be Lost or compromised&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is also at risk of &lt;strong&gt;verbal and physical abuse or arrest&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatima has knowledge of the community and has many &lt;strong&gt;strong relationships&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/sy_majeed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majeed is a civil society activist who works with a &lt;strong&gt;large network&lt;/strong&gt; of Syrian activists involved in efforts to advocate for democracy. He is well respected within this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He needs to use a plethora of &lt;strong&gt;communication applications&lt;/strong&gt; to coorainate with activists and influencers. Communication is critical to their cause and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majeed is most concerned that he will become a &lt;strong&gt;target&lt;/strong&gt; of the Syrian government and their allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majeed needs to maintain contact with many activists, but wants to &lt;strong&gt;reduce the number of applications&lt;/strong&gt; he uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also needs to reduce the &lt;strong&gt;risks&lt;/strong&gt; he faces and exposes others to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is afraid that personal information or incriminating data about him or his network will be &lt;strong&gt;exposed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is worried about &lt;strong&gt;losing contact&lt;/strong&gt; with people due to application deprecation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that Majeed&amp;rsquo;s devices could be &lt;strong&gt;lost or confiscated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majeed is computer and mobile literate and is also aware of &lt;strong&gt;digital threats&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is well respected and is considered a &lt;strong&gt;leader&lt;/strong&gt; in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is not dependent on the &lt;strong&gt;government internet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many &lt;strong&gt;communication applications&lt;/strong&gt; out there. How do I know which is the best?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more applications I use, the more I am &lt;strong&gt;exposed to risk&lt;/strong&gt; if one is compromised. How can I mitigate that?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Syria: &#34;Marwa&#34;</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/personas/sy_m/</link>

      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/sy_m/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marwa is a 20-year-old journalist who grew up in Syria, later moving to a neighboring country due to increased violence in her region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience has made her &lt;strong&gt;resilient and quick to adapt&lt;/strong&gt;. Although she has fled the physical danger of conflict in Syria, she now faces new threats because of her profession, from &lt;strong&gt;targeted surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;advanced malware&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as an increasing number of border skirmishes and &lt;strong&gt;assassination attempts&lt;/strong&gt; on journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses a wide-range of applications, but most notably Facebook, to share her stories with a broader audience inside and outside of Syria. She is often willing to take risks and has been &lt;strong&gt;desensitized&lt;/strong&gt; to a point where securing her data is not a high priority most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She needs to &lt;strong&gt;communicate and share&lt;/strong&gt; what is happening in Syria as efficiently as she can, sometimes as a form of criticism or dissent, but mostly to &lt;strong&gt;disseminate information&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;raise awareness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also requires regular communication with her &lt;strong&gt;vast network&lt;/strong&gt; of friends and followers (some of whom she does not necessarily know personally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing attacks&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;malware&lt;/strong&gt; exposure to her devices both from &lt;strong&gt;state and non-state actors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; of her communication by both the hostcountry and Syria and &lt;strong&gt;misinformation&lt;/strong&gt; about their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/strong&gt; and unintentionally putting others at risk through their connection with her, particularly family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revealing networks due to &lt;strong&gt;device confiscation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fearless journalist&lt;/strong&gt; with a strong voice and a powerful message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very &lt;strong&gt;adaptable&lt;/strong&gt; to a range of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committed to returning home and supporting her people in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I trust that what you’re telling me is true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I &lt;strong&gt;secure my social networks&lt;/strong&gt;? And how can communicate with my network if they don’t use a particular tool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting my message out is more important than security. What are some ways I can &lt;strong&gt;balance&lt;/strong&gt; this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I protect myself and my friends?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/ug_jomeo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jomeo is in his late twenties and based in Uganda. He works with &lt;strong&gt;anti-corruption&lt;/strong&gt; groups to create &lt;strong&gt;public awareness&lt;/strong&gt; about the ongoing and severe violations and abuses of human rights by both public and private individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work involves &lt;strong&gt;monitoring and documenting human rights violations&lt;/strong&gt; and corruption through digital media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is not very experienced in the use of technology to collect sensitive information, but he has used Signal and PGP to communicate securely with his contacts. The group he works with has some technical capacity and experience with digital security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jomeo wants to continue to use the internet as a primary medium to expose corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He needs to &lt;strong&gt;build his capacity&lt;/strong&gt; to promote governance, human rights, accountability, and transparency through social media and avid blogging. He also needs to maintain a &lt;strong&gt;secure&lt;/strong&gt; environment to protect his work and his sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the target of &lt;strong&gt;intimidation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;harrassment&lt;/strong&gt; by police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office and home &lt;strong&gt;raids&lt;/strong&gt; lead to the &lt;strong&gt;confiscation&lt;/strong&gt; of phones, laptops, flash disks, modems, and soft and hard copies of documents by security operatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; is a concern, as phones have been tapped. Other concerns include &lt;strong&gt;imprisonment&lt;/strong&gt; and degradation of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jomeo has previously attended &lt;strong&gt;security trainings&lt;/strong&gt;. He learned how to maintain strong passwords, enable 2-step verification, and how to securely communicate via encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also backs up confidential documents to ensure &lt;strong&gt;safe storage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His groups are helping keep him up-to-date with digital security measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can happen to me if I am &lt;strong&gt;arrested&lt;/strong&gt; without my colleagues knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I &lt;strong&gt;communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with my contacts about the arrest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul is LGBTI in Uganda, where it is &lt;strong&gt;illegal&lt;/strong&gt; and not socially accepted. He faces both &lt;strong&gt;ostracism and physical risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul and his organization work with politicians and civil society leaders to improve the acceptance of LGBTI issues across Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is currently leading an internal project at his organization to improve their &lt;strong&gt;security practices&lt;/strong&gt; - both at the organization and at many staff members&amp;rsquo; homes, they have biometric alarm systems installed after a series of break-ins and office raids where laptops were stolen. Other practices Paul is working to address are sharing laptops in the office and discouraging using cybercafes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is between 29 and 35. He is single and lives alone, as his close family have emigrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping himself and his colleagues safe &amp;ndash; both at their office and their homes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining ability to &lt;strong&gt;advocate&lt;/strong&gt; for social change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ability to have an active social and family life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong social norms against LGBTI - including everyday people, religious fundamentalists, police with prejudices, and &lt;strong&gt;illegality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office and home &lt;strong&gt;raids and robberies;&lt;/strong&gt; including the seizure of laptops. Stolen information can be sold to the media, which &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; activists publicly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intense government &lt;strong&gt;surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; of activist and NGO activity using powerful tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul has readily adopted many digital security practices - enabling &lt;strong&gt;two factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; for accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul has developed complex &lt;strong&gt;operational security&lt;/strong&gt; practices, such as having personal protocols of how to engage with new contacts in public spaces instead of at the office, to reduce associational risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recent office raids, Paul and other staff have moved to saving documents in cloud storage and not on laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I &lt;strong&gt;protect information&lt;/strong&gt; against my devices being confiscated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I encourage colleagues, partners, and funders to adopt better security practices?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna is a middle-aged woman, working for an &lt;strong&gt;anti-corruption&lt;/strong&gt; non-governmental organization in Ukraine. She leads many cases against high-profile corruption within the Ukrainian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She &lt;strong&gt;stores important documents&lt;/strong&gt; on her Laptop. She uses &lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/strong&gt; to communicate with her team and family. She often needs to &lt;strong&gt;print documents&lt;/strong&gt; in order to file legal requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to win her cases against &lt;strong&gt;corrupted officials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to keep herself and her team merrnbers &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;state-Level actors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her phone was &lt;strong&gt;stolen&lt;/strong&gt; and then returned by a ranaom person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her team conversations on WhatsApp have been repeatedly &lt;strong&gt;leaked&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some documents on her device that could potentially &lt;strong&gt;incriminate&lt;/strong&gt; her and other innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna uses &lt;strong&gt;full-disk encryption&lt;/strong&gt; and all of her devices are &lt;strong&gt;password protected&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses WhatsApp for all important conversations and has &lt;strong&gt;2-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; enabled on all important accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone &lt;strong&gt;break into my device&lt;/strong&gt; if it is locked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told that WhatsApp is safe, so how can our information be &lt;strong&gt;repeatedly leaked&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ukraine: &#34;Maksym&#34;</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/personas/ua-maksym/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:15:28 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/ua-maksym/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maksym is in his late twenties and works as a history teacher in Ukraine. During his free time, &lt;strong&gt;he works as an admin and editor for a social media page&lt;/strong&gt; of a local activist group. The group fights against city gentrification and the destruction of local parks for residential development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He uses his Laptop to access his personal pages and advocacy groups on &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;VKontakte&lt;/strong&gt;. He uses &lt;strong&gt;Telegram&lt;/strong&gt; to communicate with his fellow activists and ephemeral online notepads (i.e. privnote.com) for sensitive communication. He uses different &lt;strong&gt;VPN clients&lt;/strong&gt; to access VKontakte pages that are blocked in Ukraine due to sanctions on Russia, as a large part of his audience still uses the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wants to keep his true identity secret in order to &lt;strong&gt;protect his job&lt;/strong&gt; as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He needs to me sure that his Facebook pages are &lt;strong&gt;secure&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;available&lt;/strong&gt; at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wants to &lt;strong&gt;engage the local community&lt;/strong&gt; in the struggLe against gentrification and corruption of city officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several members of his group have been temporarily &lt;strong&gt;arrested&lt;/strong&gt; in the past on fake charges and their devices were &lt;strong&gt;confiscated&lt;/strong&gt;. Their &lt;strong&gt;social media pages were deleted&lt;/strong&gt; after devices were confiscated by authorities. This caused them to lose a large portion of their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is afraid that his &lt;strong&gt;identity will be revealed&lt;/strong&gt; by law enforcement or corrupt officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maksym&amp;rsquo;s devices are &lt;strong&gt;password protected&lt;/strong&gt; and he has &lt;strong&gt;2-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; enabled on all important accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He uses Telegram for most conversations and privnote.com for sensitive communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also uses &lt;strong&gt;aliases&lt;/strong&gt; on all his personal social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone &lt;strong&gt;track me&lt;/strong&gt; using my phone number (since you do not need to register a SIM card with a specific name in Ukraine yet)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I do to &lt;strong&gt;protect our social media pages&lt;/strong&gt; from being deleted if my devices were to be seized?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ukraine: &#34;Masha&#34;</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/personas/ua-m/</link>

      <guid>https://usable.tools/personas/ua-m/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masha is based in Kyiv, and works for an NGO tracking &lt;strong&gt;human rights violations&lt;/strong&gt; ocurring in the contested Donetsk region of Eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She coordinates monitoring missions of volunteers who travel into Donetsk to interview and document violations using their &lt;strong&gt;cell phones&lt;/strong&gt;, and return to &lt;strong&gt;share and organize the information&lt;/strong&gt;. Her responsibility is to plan the missions and logistics, select and send volunteers to the area, and &lt;strong&gt;monitor their work and safety&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masha is an &lt;strong&gt;experienced user&lt;/strong&gt; of digital security tools, including &lt;strong&gt;encrypted email&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;password managers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the volunteer network she works with has high turn-over, and different skill levels and understanding of digital security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She needs the ability to &lt;strong&gt;track the volunteers&amp;rsquo; movement&lt;/strong&gt; in the area in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fast, safe tool to synchronize data from volunteer smartphones, so the data does not get &lt;strong&gt;confiscated and lost&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers need an &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;SOS&amp;rdquo; button&lt;/strong&gt; for when there is no time to communicate, but need to send an alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation the volunteers gather is &lt;strong&gt;very sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; to both sides of the conflict; neither side wants these facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve the information and keep the volunteers safe, they need to &lt;strong&gt;remove the data from the mobile phone&lt;/strong&gt; as fast as possible, as the &lt;strong&gt;devices may be seized&lt;/strong&gt; at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in Donetsk is &lt;strong&gt;unpredictable&lt;/strong&gt;, and communications channels may go down without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced user who has been trained in and adopted digital security methods. She has &lt;strong&gt;different passwords&lt;/strong&gt; for different services, and &lt;strong&gt;updates her software&lt;/strong&gt; regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She uses &lt;strong&gt;file encryption&lt;/strong&gt; for files on her laptop, and uses gmail with &lt;strong&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; for her email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volunteers have &lt;strong&gt;widely different levels&lt;/strong&gt; of tech skills and need tools which are &lt;strong&gt;fast to learn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;easy to use&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to the information if the &lt;strong&gt;mobile phone is confiscated&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can it work if &lt;strong&gt;communications are blocked&lt;/strong&gt; or completely cut off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I safely &lt;strong&gt;track the location&lt;/strong&gt; of the volunteers without revealing that information to anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses his mobile phone and iPad for &lt;strong&gt;communicating with colleagues&lt;/strong&gt;, sources, and others. He also &lt;strong&gt;takes photos&lt;/strong&gt; for Facebook stories on his mobile phone and iPad and &lt;strong&gt;stores sensitive files&lt;/strong&gt; on his laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has to leave his laptop in hotels and connect to &lt;strong&gt;public WiFi&lt;/strong&gt; near combat areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His laptop can be &lt;strong&gt;searched&lt;/strong&gt; at the border or check-point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His Google and Facebook accounts could be targets of &lt;strong&gt;phishing attempts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has also attended a one-day &lt;strong&gt;digital security training&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses &lt;strong&gt;2-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; with Gmail, Google Drive, and Facebook. However, he is always &lt;strong&gt;forgetting his passwords&lt;/strong&gt;. He writes the passwords down on a sheet of paper, but still sometimes struggles with logging in to his Gmail account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he is a lawyer, he is not aware of how police are inspecting devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He needs to be able to &lt;strong&gt;store sensitive data&lt;/strong&gt; safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wants to make sure human rights defenders are not &lt;strong&gt;imprisoned&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threats&#34;&gt;Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His laptop, smart phone, or flash drives could be &lt;strong&gt;confiscated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the border, authorities could gain access to his devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could be the target of &lt;strong&gt;malware&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;phishing attacks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knows the laws and can access &lt;strong&gt;remote IT support&lt;/strong&gt; when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>SOUPS 2019 Workshop Designing for the Extremes of Risk</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-soups/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2019 23:50:48 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-soups/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-usable-project-team-will-host-a-workshop-at-soups-2019httpswwwusenixorgconferencesoups2019&#34;&gt;The USABLE Project team will host a workshop at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2019&#34;&gt;SOUPS 2019&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will cover how to adapt UX design and user feedback collection techniques when working with high-risk communities, through an overview of the different marginalized groups and their needs that the USABLE.tools project have worked with from around the world over the past 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USABLE.tools project builds feedback loops around the globe by connecting at-risk communities with digital security trainers, usability experts, and security tool developers. USABLE has worked with over 50 trainers and engaged end users in high-risk areas, and supported open source security and privacy tools with funding as well as direct design and implementation support to take this feedback and incorporate it into their tools through human-centered design processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the project will discuss their methodology and outcomes from working with regional and local digital security trainers from around the world to gather feedback and build personas to represent marginalized, vulnerable, and other at-risk communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;call-for-presentations&#34;&gt;Call for Presentations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome community input (via a simplified Call for Papers/Projects) to present on similar topics and then via breakout groups discuss open questions around building lasting structures to help designers and tool developers responsibly solicit and implement feedback from at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please submit a short summary (less than 1000 words, approximately 2 pages) of your work, with references/websites/papers linked if relevant, and what topic you&amp;rsquo;d want to present on during the workshop to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Connect+CFP@usable.tools&#34;&gt;Connect+CFP@usable.tools&lt;/a&gt;, plaintext/markdown formats preferred, PGP keys for encryption available on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop paper submission deadline: Friday, May 30, 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop paper acceptance notification to authors: Saturday, June 8, 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop camera-ready papers due: Wednesday, June 19, 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;logistics&#34;&gt;Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USENIX will be charging a registration fee ($75 per half day tutorial/workshop, $150 for full day) this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All USABLE project events are governed by our &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/codeofconduct&#34;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, SOUPS is governed by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/conferences/coc&#34;&gt;USENIX Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing New USABLE Personas</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2018-12-28-new-usable-personas/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2018-12-28-new-usable-personas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through a series of regional User Experience (UX) Workshops, the USABLE project is enhancing digital security trainers’ understanding of specific usability roadblocks that hinder adoption of important security practices for the highest risk groups across the globe and how to capture and articulate these challenges to tool developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/personas/sd_fatima&#34; title=&#34;Persona: Fatima from Sudan&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/personas/sd-fatima.png&#34; alt=&#34;Persona: Fatima from Sudan&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: .5em; border: 0; width: 30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personas&lt;/strong&gt;, or general profiles or snapshots of end users, play an important role in the design process and allow developers (who are largely male and based in the U.S. and Europe) to better understand the needs and use-cases for their products in some of the most challenging environments in the world. Too often developers in the open source community rely on assumptions from their respective locations and experiences, which is dramatically different from the lived experiences of high-risk groups using their products. Whether they are designing for a human rights activist in China or a journalist reporting on the frontlines in Crimea, for developers to design products that are useful and usable, they must better understand who their users are, their motivations, and willingness to adopt such important security tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/personas/cu_yasmany&#34; title=&#34;Persona: Yasmany from Cuba&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/personas/cu-yasmany.png&#34; alt=&#34;Persona: Yasmany from Cuba&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin: .5em; border: 0; width: 30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; During the five regional UX Workshops, trainers learned how to create and use personas to communicate with tool developers. These personas include a brief description of the user, along with a summary of their goals, strengths, and threats they face. It also includes questions from the user about specific tools or security concerns, giving the developer insight into the users’ mental model around security in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/personas/ky_alexandria&#34; title=&#34;Persona: Alexandria from Kenya&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/personas/ky-alexandria.png&#34; alt=&#34;Persona: Alexandria from Kenya&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: .5em; border: 0; width: 30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Trainers were also given time during the workshop to create their own personas based on specific communities with whom they are working. Following the workshops, the USABLE team worked with several of the trainers to finalize their personas and format them for publication. &lt;strong&gt;6 personas from Southeast Asia, 5 from Europe and Eurasia, 4 from the Middle East and Northern Africa, 3 from Sub-Saharan Africa, and 3 from Latin America were published and are now available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/personas&#34;&gt;usable.tools/personas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From LGBTQI advocates to journalists, these personas capture a variety of user backgrounds, experiences, and needs. The goal is that developers will be able to use these personas to better understand the individuals using their tools, and will then be positioned to make more informed design choices that ultimately make tools more secure and accessible for high-risk users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UXForum 2018: Dublin, Ireland</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/events/uxforum-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2018 23:50:48 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/events/uxforum-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second UXForum took place in Dublin, Ireland in July 2018. The event brought together human rights defenders, digital security trainers, design experts, and software developers to discuss how to capture and integrate user feedback from high-risk communities on digital security tools, and make those tools stronger and more effective as a result. Over 20 different countries were represented at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over eight tool team representatives, from password managers to VPN tools, attended the event and had opportunities to directly connect and understand security challenges at risk groups across the globe face when doing their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two days of the UXForum focused exclusively on the Internet Freedom community. Digital security trainers, UX experts, and open source privacy and security tool developers began by discussing larger themes, such as localization, accessibility, and transparency. Tool teams were also given time to connect directly with individuals using their tools. During these sessions, developers were able to share some of their priorities for improvements as well as answer questions and collect feedback from users. A series of discussions happened during the first two days. Topics covered included, but were not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional Use Cases for Personas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective Ways for Communicating Feedback to Developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing for Users with Disabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation and User Onboarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustaining Tool Usage Post-Trainings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final two days consisted of more structured panel discussions. These sessions were also open to private sector attendees. The President of Internews Jeanne Bourgault provided the opening keynote address. The following two days were filled with dynamic and informative panels covering topics ranging from designing for extremes to understanding security challenges in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forum was impactful for all attendees and the small scale of the gathering allowed for the diverse attendees to easily connect with one another. For several tool developers, this was the first time they had connected with non-Western users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional financial support for the UXForum was received from Facebook, Balsamiq, and the Ford Foundation. This support allowed the USABLE team to bring additional digital security trainers representing diverse backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USABLE at RightsCon 2018</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-rightscon-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2018 23:50:48 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/events/usable-at-rightscon-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE team led two sessions at RightsCon 2018 in Toronto. The first of these sessions, entitled, “Making the Tech USABLE &amp;ndash; how to gather and share user feedback from our digital security trainings,” was co-facilitated with Defend Defenders, one of our partners in East Africa, and a trainer from the East Africa UX Workshop. The session consisted of a UX Activity for feedback collection, where participants were split into smaller groups and acted as training participants, providing feedback on five specific tasks in the Signal app. After completing these tasks on the app, the participants provided feedback using a 1-5 scale on the difficulty in completing those tasks. After the activity, the groups came together to exchange feedback on the tool as well as the usefulness of the UX Activity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second session co-led with, the Design Lead at Access Now, was a UX/Tech Meet-up. The goal of the meetup was to connect talents across sectors and to share experiences and lessons from existing projects. Everyone introduced themselves to the group and explained their interest in/experience with UX/UI. The group then divided and focused in on two themes. One group focused on specific resources (either existing or needed) that could be used within the UX context, while the other focused on highlighting tangible opportunities for collaboration among those attending the meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sessions at RightsCon, along with various side meetings, provided a space to create connections, introduce USABLE to new tool teams and individuals, and advertise for the second UXForum, which happened just a few months after RightsCon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USABLE Updates, Resources and more!</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-09-19-followingup/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been two months since the UXForum!  To be fair, we had a lot of sleep to catch up on, and there have been some exciting staff transitions over on our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Megan (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Megan@usable.tools&#34;&gt;Megan@usable.tools&lt;/a&gt;) will be leading USABLE while Jon takes on directorship of our global portfolio (including supporting USABLE!).  We are also onboarding additional program support to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/persona.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sample Persona&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: .5em;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve added a massive &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/resources&#34;&gt;Resources page&lt;/a&gt; that captures a ton of links and references from the UXForum, our reading lists, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have some new &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/personas&#34;&gt;User Personas&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ve put together from the UXForum and TFT work with our communities.  These personas represent a wide variety of users of digital security tools facing a mix of threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have created these from many common shared experiences, but for the privacy of our communities, none are 1:1 connected, and all are created from a combination of people and the work they do.  The photos are public domain or Creative Commons stock photography, and the names are of course made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working with a few teams to support UX walkthroughs, accessibility, and user testing of open source digital secutrity tools!  We will be focusing on our UXFund grantees first, but please ping us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:connect@usable.tools&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:connect@usable.tools&#34;&gt;connect@usable.tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you are a tool developer and are interested in this &amp;ndash; and also check Open Technology Fund&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opentech.fund/lab/usability-lab&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Usability Lab&lt;/a&gt; they run in partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplysecure.org&#34;&gt;SimplySecure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Power to the Users -- From trainings to the UXForum and onwards.</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-09-15-powertotheusers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-09-15-powertotheusers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, I led a digital security training for independent media in Kyiv during the peak of the EuroMaidan protests. &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/local-voices-global-change/what-good-are-secure-communications-tools-if-no-one-uses-them-690ce2bdf9ec#.hla4lsxya&#34;&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t go as planned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring, we returned.  We worked with an amazingly skilled trainer who led the local &lt;a href=&#34;https://dss380.org/&#34;&gt;Digital Security School&lt;/a&gt; which had since emerged thanks to the hard work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://equalit.ie/&#34;&gt;eQualit.ie&lt;/a&gt;, and we brought together an amazing community of experts and practitioners who face complex challenges in their work as they dealt with the repercussions of the post-Maidan Ukrainian reality.  This alone would have made for a successful training; but our goal with USABLE is to scale beyond this and get to underlying problems around tool uptake.  So, we also brought a designer (who is now leading frog design&amp;rsquo;s social impact team) and a developer who led a digital security tool that the community was interested in learning more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/uxforum-bigboard.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Notes on strong passwords and laptop security from the UXForum&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building this &amp;ldquo;Tool Feedback Training&amp;rdquo; approach to connecting high-risk users and tool developers through the training and design process, and the results we have already achieved, has been an amazing journey.  It may &amp;ndash; and should &amp;ndash; seem simple, but the complexities of making that precise connection is far too often presumed, but not actually done. Real people facing very specific and complex security challenges become an amorphous &amp;ldquo;they.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rdquo; needs many things from constant, bleeding-edge security improvements to changes supporting very specific use cases; but it turns out that if you actually engage the people beyond the &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; - that you learn real, often simple, changes in user experience are the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyiv training followed tightly on the heels of another, and we then went on to test this approach out in 5 total communities across the globe, from LGBTI activists to election monitors to media activists to women journalists to persons with disabilities.  Each training blew our minds in new and amazing ways.  Can the tool protect you against both censorship and intense surveillance? Can it be used with a screen reader? Does it work offline if the network is shut down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/local-voices-global-change/protecting-high-risk-tech-users-a-movement-for-usability-afd5fde58c2b#.5h2s5njw5&#34;&gt;Hear from some of the digital security trainers we worked with directly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these events across the world and thanks to our funders, including the Department of Human Rights and Labor, Yahoo!  and Vodafone, we were able to bring the facilitators and many of the participants back together for a week-long event in San Francisco - the first ever UXForum for digital security tools. The Forum brought the trainers, designers, developers, and at least one community member from each of our Tool Feedback Trainings, as well as inviting in additional members of the open source and corporate communities. We worked through difficult problems impacting all of the communities, shared stories and threats faced, and mapped out ways to move forward - how to better connect users, trainer, and developers, how to weave user testing into trainings effectively, and developers and designers worked on paper prototypes and explored using their tools through screen readers. Yahoo! even hosted the trainers and community representatives to share their experience at Yahoo! and visit with Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s UX and Accessibility labs - read more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://yahoobhrp.tumblr.com/post/148985458174/security-and-product-design-with-human-rights-in&#34;&gt;Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week closed with some clear next steps and, at the open-to-the-public &amp;ldquo;UX in a High Risk World&amp;rdquo; event; the opening of the UXFund, targeting usability enhancements to open source digital security tools committed to user engagement throughout the process.  The Fund&amp;rsquo;s first round closes at the end of this month &amp;ndash; apply at &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/uxfund&#34;&gt;/uxfund&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>User Testing in Digital Security Training</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-07-07-usertesting/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2016 10:47:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-07-07-usertesting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During our first Tool Feedback Training, we faced some natural reluctance to &amp;ldquo;complain&amp;rdquo; about a tool being trained upon, which was magnified by the effect of having a representative from the tool in the training.  To accommodate this, we leveraged the high number of facilitators during each hands-on activity to gather observational data. The trainer would set a short goal (create an account, create a record, share a record), and the participants would work in small groups to accomplish this task, with a facilitator observing each group to note where confusion or problems were occurring.  To balance this with maintaining the flow of the training, the facilitators would keep each group from floundering, and the trainer would review the process for everyone before moving onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/TFT-usertesting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essentially provided user testing during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/preparing-ADIDS-sessions/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ADIDS&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;deepening&amp;rdquo; stage by encouraging exploration to achieve these goals. Between activities, the facilitators could dive in and ask more about the problematic parts of the process without embarrassing either the tool developer or individual participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We brought this same strategy to the second TFT, and had challenges working across language barriers. This approach requires both a hands-on session with very definable &amp;ldquo;steps&amp;rdquo;, and a grouping structure that also works with the participants, the size of the group, and any translation needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We approached this slightly differently at each training, and it provided valuable insights into tool usability with specific pain-points from users.  Some version of this could be worked into the broader digital security training process to create a feedback loop from trainers, representing their participants, and tool developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/uxforum.html&#34;&gt;UXForum&lt;/a&gt; next week we will be talking about how different approaches worked across the different communities we worked with to find any common approaches to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-08-15-yahoo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our friends over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://yahoobhrp.tumblr.com/post/148985458174/security-and-product-design-with-human-rights-in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; for a great blog post outlining their amazing support of our work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;security-and-product-design-with-human-rights-in-mind&#34;&gt;Security and Product Design with Human Rights in Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Katie Shay, Legal Counsel, Business &amp;amp; Human Rights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-posted from  &lt;a href=&#34;https://yahoobhrp.tumblr.com/post/148985458174/security-and-product-design-with-human-rights-in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Business &amp;amp; Human Rights, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/YahooBHRP&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/YahooBHRP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve security trainers, tool developers and human rights activists from four continents came to our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Their mission? To share their unique perspectives with our Yahoo products, engineering, security, public policy and legal teams. Yahoo’s Business &amp;amp; Human Rights Program, the Paranoids and Yahoo for Good orchestrated this ‘hack of the minds’ in partnership with Internews and the USABLE Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USABLE Project’s aim is to inform the development of security tools that are easy to use and simple to understand for users from diverse backgrounds and skill levels. Their goal is to support vulnerable populations around the world who use the internet for more than just sharing pictures of cats or Venmoing a friend for lunch. In many cases, these users rely on the internet to exercise their right to free expression, expose corruption or fight against injustice in their communities. For these users, the ability to be secure online is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Yahoo was proud to sponsor the USABLE Project’s first ever public forum, UX in a High Risk World in San Francisco, bringing together frontline digital security practitioners, users, tool developers and UX experts from around the world. In addition, Yahoo participated in the final day of USABLE’s four-day closed-door workshop leading up to this event, working directly with this community to build concrete, actionable roadmaps to improve usability in security tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the forum, the delegation from USABLE that visited Yahoo shared their on-the-ground perspective on why remaining secure online is so important to their work. They explained how they use Yahoo products, including Flickr and Mail, why it’s important to have a principled approach to responding to government requests for user data and content moderation, as well as the importance of baking in security features to products from the outset by turning them on by default. These visionary leaders are working toward solutions for activists facing censorship, hacking, surveillance and suppression in some of the world’s most challenging environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the delegation’s visit, our Yahoo teams asked pointed questions to understand the experience of some of our most vulnerable users and to explore how their experiences might inform Yahoo’s product development and online security work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are grateful to the USABLE team for sharing their stories with us, and for inspiring our teams to continue to find new and innovative ways to put our users first!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protecting High-Risk Tech Users: A Movement for Usability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting developers with users improves tools for human rights defenders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janvier Hakizimana has a radical idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Governments and large global bodies like the United Nations subsidize new medications to fight disease. Why not also subsidize the adaptation of technology so that it can meet the needs of local communities?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptation — making tech tools more open, accessible, and customizable — matters in Janvier’s line of work. He works to support human rights defenders in the East and Horn of Africa who need secure tools to document and report human rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/usability-secure-apps-screen readers_Credit_Mariel Garcia M.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Testing the usability of secure apps through screen readers, at a USABLE training in Mexico. Credit: Mariel Garcia&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a tool can’t adapt to local conditions — when it is entirely reliant on an internet connection, for example, users in low-connectivity areas may not be able to use it on a broad scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on a hodge-podge of tools that each does one thing well makes work inefficient. Worse, relying on tools that aren’t secure puts high-risk communities in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janvier supports human rights defenders, in part as a trainer for USABLE, a project designed to connect high-risk users of digital security and communications tools with the developers who make those tools, in order to make the tools usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, USABLE will hold its first UX Forum in San Francisco, bringing digital security trainers and activists from Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East with developers in the center of US tech development, for three days of hands-on collaboration. USABLE’s focus on human-centered design focuses the process on the real-world needs of activists working on sexual orientation and gender identity rights, media, democracy, and human rights in challenging and threatening environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mariel Garcia M, a technologist and USABLE trainer in Mexico, has seen first-hand the real risks for activists. “[Mexico] is a country where activists are at great risk; not just of intervention of their communications, but they’re also at risk of death, and torture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while Mariel finds activists are well aware of the risks — “If you talk to activists who have been active since the sixties, they will tell you never to speak on the phone,” she says — there are numerous road blocks to their use of secure tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many developers and many of us would think if you have a secure tool, and your choices are secure or not secure, the activist will choose secure, but that doesn’t explain all the things that go into the decision-making process,” she says. “What if they’re the only person using that secure messaging app, and none of their friends are? Do they want to invest their efforts in getting everyone to adopt that tool, when they could be focusing on the next protest they’re organizing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being outside the tech community also hinders adoption. “You have to be in certain tech circles to know that there is this tool, or to keep up with the discussion. What if this tool stops being developed — will [the activists] ever find out? They will have been to one workshop where they heard about it, but to stay updated, you really need to be part of a tech community, and many of them don’t do any tech-related work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, trainer Mykola Kostynyan has seen a dramatic change in awareness around digital security since the Euromaidan protests in 2013, but like Mariel, sees long-term change as a challenge for organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before Euromaidan we hadn’t even heard of digital security — it wasn’t an issue. Now, thousands of people have awareness after going through training. A lot of organizations are migrating corporate email to more secure systems, and storing and transferring documents in more secure ways. We can see a lot of interest. We are very far from the ideal situation, where each organization has security policy implemented and has people responsible for that. We are very far.”
The need for continuity and long-range organizational change directly supports Janvier’s idea, that adaptation of technology is worthy of broad support and investment by governments, and shouldn’t be left to one-off solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“User-friendly software development is not really promoted and well-funded,” says Janvier, giving an example of a software project that was funded for five years of development, and rolled out to the local NGO community in Uganda, but ultimately abandoned. “Instead of starting new project, we would like to have software which will be used by this generation, and improved for next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the trainers say there’s just no way to know all the needs of users without asking. Mariel recently led a USABLE workshop with activists focused on the needs of the visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/Rock-Paper-Scissors-visual disability_Credit_Mariel Garcia M.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;From a USABLE conference in Mexico, participants demonstrate an adaptation of Rock, Paper, Scissors for players with visual disability.

&lt;p&gt;“Most digital security trainers have plenty of experience with the difficulties that people face when they don’t have disabilities. For example we know that a certain app has this particular bug. A digital security trainer can give you a pretty exhaustive list of what goes wrong with all these tools. But not many of us are in the community that needs special tools, like audio readers [for the visually impaired]. It brings interesting security risks. For example, how do the visually impaired use secure applications if the buttons are not properly tagged for screen readers to read aloud?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools made with accessibility in mind are not necessarily made with security in mind, and vice versa, which is why building connections between users and developers is so vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish that people would come together more often to collaborate at all levels. So that all the valuable feedback I gathered from one tool would reach the developer, and that someone would fund that. Trainings should be more informed by the people developing the tools, who have a deeper understating of how [the technology] works. I’m really excited to see USABLE promoting this kind of collaboration. I think it’s been missing from the ecosystem,” says Mariel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I have connections with developers,” says Mykola, “I can give them some advice. And maybe try to get tool user sessions here in Ukraine independently, to test new tools and give feedback to developers — to start more than a separate event, more of a movement for usability.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning how to balance design and training</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-01-22-tft/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2016 13:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2016-01-22-tft/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE team is halfway through our &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/trainings.html&#34;&gt;Tool Feedback Training&lt;/a&gt; process, and the first two TFTs were hugely informative. We worked with groups doing amazing work while facing widely different challenges; including censorship, targeted malware, and situations where digital security problems can become physical security ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns we had going in to this process was balancing the digital security training for the participants with human-centered design exercises, which is why we spent so much time working through this during our &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/2015/11/20/securitydesigworkshop.html&#34;&gt;Security and Design Workshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both trainings however, the participants not only responded enthusiastically to the design exercises we conducted, but expressed ongoing interest in applying design thinking to their project work. The design-centric agenda items have actually meshed well with the digital security curricula, engaging participants in the design process, creating users personas, and supporting the tool developers in coming up with prototyped design changes. We&amp;rsquo;ll post soon on building user testing directly in to the training process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dSchool&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/The_Wallet_Project.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wallet Exercise&lt;/a&gt; has been very useful as a short, fun way to get into the mindset of design, as it leads you through a series of thought, listening, and feedback exercises with a partner. It - along with many of the other design exercises &amp;ndash; creates a great icebreaker effect by putting everyone on the same level as they work through a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/trainings.html#schedule&#34;&gt;TFT schedule&lt;/a&gt; to better reflect how these first TFTs went - you&amp;rsquo;ll see a back-and-forth between threat modeling, design exercises, and tool trainings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;alt&#34; style=&#34;color: black !important;&#34; id=&#34;schedule&#34;&gt;
									&lt;thead&gt;
										&lt;tr&gt;
											&lt;th style=&#34;color: black !important; font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;Day&lt;/th&gt;
											&lt;th style=&#34;color: black !important; font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
											&lt;!--&lt;th&gt;Facilitation&lt;/th&gt;--&gt;
										&lt;/tr&gt;
									&lt;/thead&gt;
									&lt;tbody&gt;
										&lt;tr&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Project Overview and Introduction to Design&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Experience sharing: &#34;A Day in the Life&#34;&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Threat modeling introduction&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Digital security overview&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;/ul&gt;
												&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;!--&lt;td&gt;Trainer, UX Expert&lt;/td&gt;--&gt;
										&lt;/tr&gt;
										&lt;tr&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Design exercises: &#34;The Wallet Project&#34;&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Persona creation and discussions about risks and tools&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Digital security tool training with participant observation feedback&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Defining expectations and requirements for digital security tools&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Digital security tool training with user testing observation and participant feedback&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;/ul&gt;
												&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;!--&lt;td&gt;Trainer, UX Expert, Developer&lt;/td&gt;--&gt;
										&lt;/tr&gt;
										&lt;tr&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
												&lt;li&gt;Further digital security training (depending on scope and complexity of tools)&lt;/li&gt;
												&lt;/ul&gt;
												&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;!--&lt;td&gt;Trainer, Developer&lt;/td&gt;--&gt;
										&lt;/tr&gt;
										&lt;tr&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;td&gt;
											&lt;ul&gt;
											&lt;li&gt;Review tool experience from a design perspective&lt;/li&gt;
											&lt;li&gt;Open discussion around digital security needs&lt;/li&gt;
											&lt;li&gt;Roadmap and prioritization of challenges&lt;/li&gt;
											&lt;li&gt;Finalize user personas&lt;/li&gt;
											&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
											&lt;!--&lt;td&gt;UX Expert, Developer&lt;/td&gt;--&gt;
										&lt;/tr&gt;
									&lt;/tbody&gt;
								&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the integration of thinking through how a tool works &amp;ndash; and how it could be improved &amp;ndash; deepened both TFTs. These opened discussions around how the tools interact with the risks that each group faced, and what features were most important for them to filter their choice of tools on.  The second group even built their &amp;ldquo;top 10&amp;rdquo; (well, 14) ranked list of features around secure communication tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usable; fast and easy to set up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform, mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works on slow connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tool is consistently updated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync across devices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provider cannot read messages / metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File transfer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect Forward Secrecy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Localization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good reminder that usability is security.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Training and Design</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2015-11-21-sdworkshop-trainings-and-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 12:09:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2015-11-21-sdworkshop-trainings-and-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/2015/11/20/securitydesigworkshop.html&#34;&gt;Security and Design Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, we realized that our original plan of book-ending a classic digital security training with human centered design exercises was not ideal &amp;ndash; many elements of learning and exploration that are key to training are similarly core to collaborative design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this out, we spent one afternoon running a digital security training on mobile security. We based the training on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc/resources-for-trainers/pedagogical-resources/adult-learners&#34;&gt;ADIDS adult-learning approach&lt;/a&gt;, and used a selection of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc&#34;&gt;Level Up curricula&lt;/a&gt; components, integrating human-centered design components into the flow of the training.  The rest of this post will run through the components of the training and the outcomes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADIDS model uses a mix of engagements to help adult participants learn a specific topic, starting with an opening Activity that introduces the topic in an engaging fashion, then Discussing the topic, then the lecture/training section (&amp;ldquo;Input&amp;rdquo;), followed by a hands-on &amp;ldquo;Deepening&amp;rdquo; - often installing and using a specific tool, and closing with a Synthesis that summarizes the entire topic and answers remaining questions. (Learn more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/preparing-ADIDS-sessions&#34;&gt;ADIDS at LevelUp&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the beginning Activity, we used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/activity/internet&#34;&gt;We are the Internet&lt;/a&gt; (adapting it for mobile communications) by adding in participants (wearing tin-foil hats) as the cell towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Discussion and Input sessions came from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/mobile-phones&#34;&gt;private mobile communications&lt;/a&gt; curricula set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-extra-letters-to-adids---adidemdems&#34;&gt;Adding extra letters to ADIDS - ADID&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;S?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training then shifted to a more human centered design process.  Before jumping in to working with specific tools, we added a &amp;ldquo;Design&amp;rdquo; component &amp;ndash; asking participants to provide the design elements they would want, as well as some participants were concerned about when making a secure mobile call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/design-training_comsec.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Secure Communication training brainstorm&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By having already run through some &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/2015/11/20/securitydesignworkshop.html&#34;&gt;design &amp;ldquo;warm-up&amp;rdquo; activities&lt;/a&gt;, the participants were able to throw out a collection of ideas for secure mobile communications relevant to our desires for easy communication and informed by the Activity, Discussion and Input sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then moved into the deepening component, with hands-on installation and practice using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://whispersystems.org/&#34;&gt;Signal app&lt;/a&gt;.  Signal is well-regarded as an amazingly usable app which provides high-end security without a confusing interface &amp;ndash; so it was a bit of a surprise when we discovered that there were still other improvement suggestions from the participants (in many cases due to the differing application security frameworks across iOS and Android). This underlined that even the &amp;ldquo;best in class&amp;rdquo; digital security tools can benefit from this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The issues we wrestled with, mainly around confusion with the different, but very small lock icons in the Android version, are already present in the Signal issue queue in various forms - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/4390&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Inadvertently sent insecure messages via SMS without clear notification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/2622&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;3 different padlock icons&lt;/a&gt; plus a mild confusion around the fact that the lock is absent in Signal on iOS, as Signal does not take over default messaging in the way it can on Android)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learnings from the Security and Design Workshop!</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2015-11-20-securitydesigworkshop/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 12:09:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2015-11-20-securitydesigworkshop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE project is built around a core commitment to listen - to users, to trainers, and to our partners.  As we began assembling the team of amazing designers and usability experts we are working with, a common thread emerged around a desire to connect and frame their inputs as usability experts for the digital security space and map out how they would engage during the tool feedback trainings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to bring together a Security and Design Workshop in mid November, thanks to the amazing generosity and flexibility of our partners and hosted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&amp;rsquo; new San Francisco offices&lt;/a&gt;. This gave the USABLE team a chance to go over operational security concerns for working with vulnerable populations and let the designers experience firsthand both some of the digital security tools we hope to work with, and the process of a digital security training. More importantly, however, was the chance to really dig in to our plans for integrating need-finding and human centered design into the digital security training process to create the &amp;ldquo;Tool Feedback Trainings&amp;rdquo; (TFTs) we envision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For needfinding, USABLE is integrating core aspects of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://internetfreedom.secondmuse.com/needfinding/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SecondMuse&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Internet Freedom Need Finding Toolkit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into this process to supplement our pre-training interview and engagement processes with our local partners and trainers. Members from the SecondMuse team were able to join us and help us work through their framework and adapt it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usable.tools/2015/10/09/announcing-usable.html&#34;&gt;Tool Feedback Training model in USABLE&lt;/a&gt;.  This helped us discover what information is valuable to match a community with a tool developer, as well as understanding the threats and capacity of each community that goes into digital security trainings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/designworkshop-process.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;USABLE&#39;s TFT process evolves&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the workshop, we worked on integrating HCD practices into the training process.  The final day began with a series of human centered design exercises led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; that would be adaptable for the TFT scenarios, from introductory exercises to more practical ones, such as having participants design the training or manual for a tool as a way to focus the tool&amp;rsquo;s actual interface on those aspects that truly require training, as opposed to those which could be set to secure defaults, automated, or provided as &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learnings&#34;&gt;Learnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;blending-training-with-design&#34;&gt;Blending training with design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our initial vision for the TFT schedule was an approach that bookended a more traditional digital security training with a pre- and post- session on design.  During the Workshop, it became clear that a fully integrated approach where design aspects were combined into the flow of the training would be much more effective. We did a test-run of this which we&amp;rsquo;ll detail in a future blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;building-respectful-useful-personas&#34;&gt;Building respectful, useful Personas&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another core learning from the Workshop was around the generation of the personas, and how to present this exercise in the TFTs in a way that respects the individuality of the participants while balancing the value of a cohesive, representative persona that has utility for developers.  This will not only lead to stronger outcomes, but will provide clearer representation for niche needs and barriers that sub groups of each community might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;unexpected-outcomes-are-exciting&#34;&gt;Unexpected outcomes are exciting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design exercises, even short, open-ended ones like the &amp;ldquo;5 ideas&amp;rdquo; aspect of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/The_Wallet_Project.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wallet Exercise&lt;/a&gt; can also be conducted even without a specific tool in mind, as a way to enable participants to design ideal theoretical tools for themselves (through a process of interviews, risk discussions, and talking about current practices).  This helps the participants and facilitators understand the community&amp;rsquo;s approach to and tolerance of risk and can reveal hidden barriers to tool adoption (such as remote connectivity, battery consumption).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can also turn up local innovations to mitigate risks, and even expose gaps where no current tools are available to meet a need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this provides a rare security training exercise with no &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-usable-is-too-usable&#34;&gt;How usable is too usable?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also wrestled with some powerful questions that could help change discussions around the pushback against some tool usability.  A classic debate has been balancing making specific complex tools easier against removing some of the deeper understanding that the users are expected to learn before using them.  In response to this, ThoughtWorks&amp;rsquo; design lead asked &amp;ldquo;is this an educational tool or is it a usable tool?&amp;rdquo;  This led further to potential interplay not only between the UX expert and the TFT participants, but also with the co-facilitators, to help identify the aspects of the trainings where the process tends to be &amp;ldquo;just do these 12 steps&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; and identifying how to better automate or hide those processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;preparation-and-follow-up&#34;&gt;Preparation and follow-up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop underlined the importance of follow-up interactions among each TFT &amp;ldquo;ground team&amp;rdquo; (Internews, the UX designer, and the trainer, with developers once identified) to provide further operational security guidance as relevant to the country and community, as well as to enable the UX expert and the trainer to co-design the need finding interviews. We will be conducting these via calls, emails, and an on-site, pre-TFT meeting of the facilitators to iron out schedules and facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing USABLE!</title>
      <link>https://usable.tools/blog/2015-10-09-announcing-usable/</link>

      <guid>https://usable.tools/blog/2015-10-09-announcing-usable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/safe.png&#34;  style=&#34;width: 25%; height: auto;&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;[☺]&#34; /&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re very excited to announce USABLE: Usable Security Apps By Leveraging End Users! USABLE, a project of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.internews.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Internews&lt;/a&gt;, brings a human centered design lens to digital security tools through a three-phase process (detailed out below) with add-on benefits of producing community-led user personas, connecting tool developers with trainers and at-risk users, and encouraging sharing of design patterns and usability challenges along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting started and are locking in our first communities, and expect to be running these needs-based trainings throughout early 2016. We will be sharing the user personas and learnings from these trainings over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://usable.tools/images/blog/usable-cycle.png&#34; alt=&#34;USABLE&#39;s Approach&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phase-i-tool-feedback-trainings&#34;&gt;PHASE I: Tool Feedback Trainings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USABLE starts by working with communities around the world with concerns about privacy and digital security because of who they are or what they do. USABLE is working with local partners on a needs assessment, and then will design a digital security training based on those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will not be a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; training (if indeed those even exist), as we will match-make the needs of the community with a digital security tool that addresses the security needs, and work with interested developers to send them to the training. In addition, a usability expert will also attend and co-facilitate, leading some &amp;ldquo;blue sky&amp;rdquo; design work, and helping the community craft a user persona to represent their capabilities, constraints, and desires to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trainings will work with each community through design exercises to reveal both pain-points with the tool they have focused on, but also broader insights into challenges which impact multiple digital security tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phase-ii-uxforum&#34;&gt;PHASE II: UXForum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phrase brings together the facilitators and key participants from each of these Tool Feedback Trainings for a 4-day workshop to cross-share the experiences, identify low-hanging fruit, and put together roadmaps to address achievable usability improvements. This &amp;ldquo;UXForum&amp;rdquo; will take place in Summer 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the UXForum, we will also run some sidebar conversations around formalizing design practices in trainings and working with developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phase-iii-uxfund&#34;&gt;PHASE III: UXFund&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third phase will be providing tool developers with funding to implement usability enhancements based on these experiences, adopting a more human-centered design approach through continued engagement with design experts, and through user-testing with the communities (where safe) and trainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;onwards&#34;&gt;Onwards!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pursuing opportunities to expand this work even further with additional Tool Feedback Trainings, and adapting and evolving our approach as we learn more from this process.  Interested in where we go next?  Please get in touch a &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@usable.tools&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:connect@usable.tools&#34;&gt;connect@usable.tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
